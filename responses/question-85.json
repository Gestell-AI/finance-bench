Specifically, focus on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statements of Income to extract the necessary data for the retention ratio calculation.\n\n2. **Detailed Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n   * **Step 1: Locate Net Income:** Find \"Net income attributable to General Mills Inc.\" from the Consolidated Statements of Income for FY2022.  Let's assume this value is X.\n\n   * **Step 2: Locate Dividends Paid:** Find \"Cash dividends paid\" from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for FY2022. Let's assume this value is Y.\n\n   * **Step 3: Calculate Retention Ratio:** Apply the formula: Retention Ratio = (Net Income - Dividends Paid) / Net Income = (X - Y) / X.  Perform this calculation using the numerical values obtained in Steps 1 and 2.  Round the final result to two decimal places.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n   * Present the final retention ratio as a decimal rounded to two decimal places.\n   * If the calculated retention ratio is 0, state \"Nothing happened\".\n   * The response should be concise and formatted as a bullet point list, clearly showing each step of the calculation.  Include the values of X and Y before calculating the final answer.\n   * Do not include commas in numerical values.  Format dollar amounts according to the provided instructions (millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero).  Percentages should be formatted to one decimal place.\n\n```\n\n* **Net Income (X):** $2707.30 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Income)\n* **Dividends Paid (Y):** $1244 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)\n* **Retention Ratio:** (X - Y) / X = (2707.30 - 1244) / 2707.30 = 0.54\n\n**Final Answer:** 0.54\n\n\n",
