1. **Document and Section:** CVSHEALTH 2018 10K; Analyze the Income Statement for FY2018 Revenue and the Balance Sheet for Net Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) for FY2017 and FY2018.

2. **Analysis and Calculations:**

   * **Step 1: Identify Total Revenues for FY2018:** Locate the "Total Revenues" or a similar line item representing the company's total revenue for the fiscal year 2018 from the income statement.  Let's assume this value is [Total Revenues FY2018].

   * **Step 2: Identify Net PP&E for FY2017 and FY2018:** Locate "Net Property, Plant, and Equipment" (PP&E) on the balance sheet for both fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Let's assume these values are [Net PP&E FY2017] and [Net PP&E FY2018] respectively.

   * **Step 3: Calculate the Average Net PP&E:**
      Average Net PP&E = ([Net PP&E FY2017] + [Net PP&E FY2018]) / 2

   * **Step 4: Calculate the Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio:**
      Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = [Total Revenues FY2018] / Average Net PP&E

   * **Step 5: Round the Result:** Round the calculated ratio to two decimal places as requested.


3. **Response Rules:**

   * Use the exact values from the CVSHEALTH 2018 10K financial statements.
   * Follow the specified formatting rules for numbers (dollar values, percentages, and ratios).
