1. Correct document to analyze: Pfizer 2023Q2 10Q.  The relevant section is the financial statements (specifically the income statement or a revenue breakdown by geographic region) and any accompanying notes that provide details on revenue changes.

2. Detailed Analysis and Calculations:

* **Locate Revenue Data:** Find the revenue figures for each geographic region for both Q2 2023 and Q2 2022.  The 10-Q should clearly break down revenue by region (e.g., US, Developed Rest of World, Emerging Markets).

* **Calculate Year-over-Year Revenue Change:** For each region, calculate the percentage change in revenue from Q2 2022 to Q2 2023 using the following formula:

   `Percentage Change = [(Q2 2023 Revenue - Q2 2022 Revenue) / Q2 2022 Revenue] * 100`

* **Identify the Largest Percentage Drop:** Compare the percentage change calculated for each region. The region with the most negative percentage change represents the biggest year-over-year drop in revenue.  If "International" is presented as a single category, treat it as "Developed Rest of the World".

3. Response Rules:

*   Present the answer as a concise bullet point.
*   Clearly state the geographic region with the largest percentage decrease in revenue.
*   Report the percentage change with one decimal place (e.g., -15.2%).
*   If no region shows a decrease, state that "No geographic region experienced a year-over-year revenue drop in Q2 2023."
*   Follow all formatting rules specified in the `Response Instructions` section of the provided document.
