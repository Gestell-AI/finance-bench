1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the BESTBUY 2017 10K document. Specifically, focus on the income statement for fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017.

2. **Analysis and Calculations:**

* **Locate Net Income:** For each fiscal year (FY2015, FY2016, FY2017), find the value of "Net Income" from the income statement.  Let's denote these values as Net Income<sub>2015</sub>, Net Income<sub>2016</sub>, and Net Income<sub>2017</sub> respectively.

* **Locate Net Revenue (or Sales):**  For each fiscal year, find the value of "Net Revenue" or "Sales" from the income statement. Let's denote these values as Revenue<sub>2015</sub>, Revenue<sub>2016</sub>, and Revenue<sub>2017</sub> respectively.

* **Calculate Net Profit Margin for Each Year:** For each year, calculate the net profit margin using the formula:

   Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Net Revenue) * 100

   Calculate Net Profit Margin<sub>2015</sub>, Net Profit Margin<sub>2016</sub>, and Net Profit Margin<sub>2017</sub>.

* **Calculate the 3-Year Average:** Add the three annual net profit margins together and divide by 3:

   3-Year Average Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit Margin<sub>2015</sub> + Net Profit Margin<sub>2016</sub> + Net Profit Margin<sub>2017</sub>) / 3

* **Round to One Decimal Place:** Round the final 3-year average to one decimal place.

3. **Response Rules:**

*   Present the final answer as a percentage with one decimal place (e.g., 5.2%).
*   If the calculation results in a value of 0, state "Nothing happened".
*   The response should be concise and in bullet points, clearly outlining each step of the calculation.  Include the values obtained from the 10K for Net Income and Net Revenue for each year.
