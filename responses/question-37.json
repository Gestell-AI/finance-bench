Focus on the financial statements and accompanying notes that detail the company's segment reporting for fiscal years 2021 (FY21) and 2022 (FY22).  Specifically, look for a breakdown of sales by reporting segment, excluding Embedded.\n\n2. **Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n* **Step 1: Identify Sales Data:** Locate the sales figures for each reporting segment (excluding Embedded) for both FY21 and FY22.  The 10K should clearly present this information in a table or within the segment discussion.\n\n* **Step 2: Calculate Proportional Increase:** For each segment, calculate the proportional increase in sales from FY21 to FY22 using the following formula:\n\n   `Proportional Increase (%) = [(FY22 Sales - FY21 Sales) / FY21 Sales] * 100`\n\n* **Step 3: Compare Proportional Increases:** Compare the calculated proportional increases for all reporting segments. Identify the segment with the highest percentage increase.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n* Present the findings in a concise, bullet-point format.\n* Clearly state the reporting segment that experienced the largest proportional sales increase from FY21 to FY22.\n* Report the proportional increase as a percentage, formatted to one decimal place (e.g., 12.3%).\n* If the proportional increase is 0%, state \"Nothing happened\".\n* If any segment shows a decrease, report the decrease as a negative percentage.  For example, a decrease of 5% would be reported as -5.0%.\n* Adhere to the specified formatting rules for dollar values and percentages as outlined in the `Response Instructions`.\n\n```\n\n* Data Center FY22: $6.0 billions\n* Data Center FY21: $3.7 billions\n* Data Center Change: $2.3 billions\n* Data Center % Change: 62.2%\n\n* Client FY22: $6.2 billions\n* Client FY21: $6.9 billions\n* Client Change: decrease in $0.7 billions\n* Client % Change: -10.1%\n\n* Gaming FY22: $6.8 billions\n* Gaming FY21: $5.6 billions\n* Gaming Change: $1.2 billions\n* Gaming % Change: 21.4%\n\n* Total Excluding Embedded FY22: $19.0 billions\n* Total Excluding Embedded FY21: $16.2 billions\n* Total Excluding Embedded Change: $2.8 billions\n* Total Excluding Embedded % Change: 17.3%\n\n**Final Answer:** Data Center sales proportionally increased the most at 62.2%.\n\n\n",
