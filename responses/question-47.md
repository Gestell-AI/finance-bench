2. **Analysis and Calculations:**

*   Locate the "Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows" section within the 10-K report. Find the line item for "Depreciation and Amortization" and note its value in USD millions. Let's assume this value is X.
*   Locate the "Consolidated Statements of Income" section within the 10-K report. Find the line item for "Operating Income" and note its value in USD millions. Let's assume this value is Y.
*   Calculate the unadjusted EBITDA using the formula provided in the Search Result Instructions:  `EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A`.  Therefore, unadjusted EBITDA = Y + X.
