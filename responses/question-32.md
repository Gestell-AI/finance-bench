1. Analyze document: AMD 2022 10K.  Specifically, extract the values for Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Accounts receivable, net, Receivables from related parties, and Current liabilities from the balance sheet for FY22.

2. Detailed analysis and calculations:

* **Step 1: Calculate Quick Assets:** Sum the values of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Accounts receivable, net, and Receivables from related parties.  This will give you the total "Quick Assets".

* **Step 2: Identify Current Liabilities:** Obtain the value of Current liabilities from the balance sheet.

* **Step 3: Calculate the Quick Ratio:** Divide the "Quick Assets" (calculated in Step 1) by the "Current Liabilities" (obtained in Step 2).  This will give you the Quick Ratio.

* **Step 4: Assess Liquidity:**  A quick ratio below 1.0 is generally considered unhealthy.  Assess whether the calculated quick ratio is above or below 1.0.  If below 1.0, state that AMD does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on this metric. If above 1.0, state that AMD does have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on this metric.  If the quick ratio is significantly above 1.0, consider mentioning that this indicates a strong liquidity position.  If it is only slightly above 1.0, consider mentioning that while technically healthy, it may be prudent to monitor the ratio closely.

* **Step 5: Relevance of Quick Ratio:**  Address the prompt's question about the relevance of the quick ratio.  While the provided formula is a variation of the standard quick ratio (excluding inventories), it still assesses the ability to meet short-term obligations with liquid assets.  Argue that it is still a relevant measure of liquidity, even if it differs slightly from the traditional formula.  However, acknowledge that other liquidity ratios (such as the current ratio) could provide a more comprehensive picture.

3. Response rules:

* Use the specified formatting rules for dollar values, percentages, and ratios.
* Present the analysis in a concise, bulleted list.
* State the calculated quick ratio with two decimal places.
* Clearly state whether AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on the calculated quick ratio, justifying the answer with the ratio's value and its interpretation.
* Explicitly address the relevance of the quick ratio to liquidity assessment, acknowledging both its usefulness and potential limitations.
* Conclude with a final answer that summarizes the liquidity assessment.

The user wants to know if AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22.
I need to calculate the quick ratio using the provided formula and then assess if the ratio indicates a healthy liquidity profile.
If the quick ratio is not relevant, I need to explain why.

**Plan:**

1. Find the values for Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Accounts receivable, net, Receivables from related parties, and Current liabilities for FY22 from the AMD 2022 10K document.
2. Calculate the quick ratio using the formula: (Cash and cash equivalents + Short-term investments + Accounts receivable, net + Receivables from related parties) / Current liabilities.
3. Assess if the calculated quick ratio indicates a healthy liquidity profile. A quick ratio of 1 or higher is generally considered healthy.
4. If the quick ratio is not relevant, explain why. billions.

- Identified current liabilities as $4.2 billions.
- Calculated quick assets: $4.6 billions + $1.3 billions + $3.1 billions + $0.0 billions = $9.0 billions.
- Calculated the quick ratio: $9.0 billions / $4.2 billions = 2.14.
- A quick ratio of 2.14 is above 1.0, indicating that AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on this metric.
- The quick ratio is relevant for measuring liquidity as it assesses a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.

**Final Answer:**
Yes, AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio of 2.14 for FY22.

## Correct Answer

Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)/ (current liabilities).
