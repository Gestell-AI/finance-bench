This will likely be found in the \"Business\" or \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n   * Carefully read the descriptions of AMD's business segments (e.g., Computing and Graphics, Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom).\n   * Identify the key product categories within each segment.  Look for specific product names or descriptions (e.g., Ryzen processors, Radeon graphics cards, EPYC server processors).\n   * Note any significant services offered alongside the products (e.g., software support, design services).\n   * Compile a list of the major product and service categories, avoiding overly granular detail.  Focus on the high-level offerings that represent the core of AMD's business.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n   * Present the major products and services as a concise, bulleted list.\n   * Use clear and concise language, avoiding technical jargon where possible.\n   * Do not include financial data or market share information unless explicitly mentioned in the 10K as a description of the product.\n   * The response should be short and focused on answering the prompt directly.  No additional analysis or interpretation is needed.\n   * The response should not include a final answer section as this is a descriptive question.\n\n```\n\n*   **Data Center:**\n    *   EPYC server processors\n    *   Instinct GPU accelerators\n    *   Pensando DPUs\n    *   FPGAs, Adaptive SoCs, and ACAP products (from Xilinx acquisition)\n    *   Alveo accelerator cards\n*   **Client:**\n    *   Ryzen processors for desktops and notebooks\n    *   Ryzen PRO mobile processors\n    *   Ryzen Threadripper PRO workstation processors\n    *   Chipsets\n*   **Gaming:**\n    *   Radeon graphics cards\n    *   Semi-custom SoC products and development services (for game consoles)\n*   **Embedded:**\n    *   Ryzen Embedded processors\n    *   Kria Robotics Starter Kit\n    *   FPGAs and Adaptive SoCs (from Xilinx acquisition)\n    *   Versal ACAP development card\n\n",
