1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the 3M 2022 10K document. Focus on the sections detailing segment performance and any discussions of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) impact.  Specifically, look for a breakdown of revenue or operating income by segment, both with and without M&A adjustments.  The Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section is likely to contain this information.

2. **Analysis:**

* **Identify Segment Performance:** Locate the data presenting the revenue or operating income for each of 3M's segments for 2022.  This data should be presented both with and without the impact of M&A activity.  If the 10K doesn't explicitly separate the impact of M&A, look for statements discussing the effects of acquisitions or divestitures on individual segments.
* **Calculate Growth (Excluding M&A):** For each segment, determine the growth rate excluding M&A. This might involve comparing the adjusted segment revenue or operating income to the prior year's figures.  The 10K may provide these growth rates directly, or you may need to calculate them using the provided financial data.
* **Identify the Underperforming Segment:** Compare the growth rates of all segments after excluding M&A. The segment with the lowest or negative growth rate is the one that dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022.

3. **Response Rules:**

*   Present the findings as a concise bullet point list.
*   Clearly state the segment that underperformed, based on the growth rate calculation excluding M&A.
*   Quantify the underperformance using the calculated growth rate (with one decimal place for percentages).
*   If no segment shows negative growth after excluding M&A, state that no single segment dragged down overall growth.  If the data is insufficient to determine the impact of M&A on a segment-by-segment basis, state that the analysis cannot be performed.
*   Follow the formatting guidelines specified in the `Response Instructions` section.  Specifically, use the correct formatting for dollar values, percentages, and ratios.
