If no materially important ongoing legal battles are found, note this explicitly.\n\n4.  If materially important ongoing legal battles are identified, create a concise, bulleted list summarizing each one according to the format specified in the Response Instructions.  Ensure that the response adheres to the formatting rules for dollar values, percentages, and ratios.  The response should clearly state whether there was an increase or decrease in the value of the legal battle and the percentage change. If there is no change, state that nothing happened.

  "answer": "Yes, CVS Health has been involved in multiple ongoing legal battles. Some notable legal dispute areas for CVS are: (1) usual and customary pricing litigation: where it's claimed that CVSâs retail pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs; (2) PBM litigation and investigations: where it's claimed that that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products; and (3) controlled substances litigation: legal matters around opioids for which CVS has agreed to pay up to $4.3 billion to claimants in remediation and $625 million to attorneys and fees",
