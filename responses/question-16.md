1. Analyze document: AES 2022 10K, specifically the income statement for Fiscal Year 2022.  Locate any line items explicitly labeled as "restructuring costs," "restructuring charges," or similar terminology.

2. Analysis and Calculation:
   * Carefully review the income statement for FY2022 within the provided 10-K document.
   * Search for line items that explicitly mention restructuring costs.
   * If such a line item exists, record the exact value.  If no such line item is found, the value is 0.

3. Response Rules:
   * If a value for restructuring costs is found, report the value in dollars according to the specified formatting rules (e.g., $100.00 millions, $10.0 billions).  Include a statement that this is the quantity of restructuring costs directly outlined in the income statement.
   * If no value is found, state: "Restructuring costs are not explicitly outlined in AES Corporation's income statement for FY2022. Therefore, the quantity is 0."
   * The response should be concise and in bullet points.  No additional commentary is needed beyond stating the value or the absence of a value.
