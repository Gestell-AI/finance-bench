For example:\n    * FY2019-FY2020 Total Revenue Growth Rate: 6.9%\n\n```\n\n* Locate Total Revenue for FY2019: $4,713,500,000\n* Locate Total Revenue for FY2020: $9,497,578,000\n* Calculate the change in Total Revenue: $9,497,578,000 - $4,713,500,000 = $4,784,078,000\n* Calculate the percentage change in Total Revenue: ($4,784,078,000 / $4,713,500,000) * 100% = 101.5%\n\n**Final Answer:** FY2019-FY2020 Total Revenue Growth Rate: 101.5%\n\n\n",
