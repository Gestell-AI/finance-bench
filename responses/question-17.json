Analyze document `AES 2022 10K`, specifically the Income Statement to find the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2022 and the Balance Sheets for the beginning and ending inventory levels for FY2022.\n\n2. **Detailed Analysis:**\n\n   * **Step 1: Locate COGS:** Find the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) figure for FY2022 from the income statement.  Let's assume (this needs to be replaced with the actual value from the 10K) the COGS is $X.\n\n   * **Step 2: Determine Beginning and Ending Inventory:** Locate the inventory values from the balance sheets.  Let's assume (this needs to be replaced with the actual values from the 10K):\n      * Beginning Inventory (FY2021 Ending Inventory): $Y\n      * Ending Inventory (FY2022 Ending Inventory): $Z\n\n   * **Step 3: Calculate Average Inventory:**\n      * Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = ($Y + $Z) / 2 = $A\n\n   * **Step 4: Compute the Inventory Turnover Ratio:**\n      * Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory = $X / $A = B\n\n   * **Step 5: Interpretation:** If the calculated ratio (B) is significantly low or zero, it suggests that conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for AES Corporation.  This is because AES is likely not a company that holds significant physical inventory in the same way a retailer or manufacturer would.  Their business model likely involves services or assets that don't fit the traditional definition of inventory.  The analysis should explicitly state this if B is low or zero.\n\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n   * Respond in a concise, bullet-point format.\n   * State the COGS, Beginning Inventory, Ending Inventory, Average Inventory, and Inventory Turnover Ratio values obtained from the 10K.\n   * If the Inventory Turnover Ratio is low or zero, explicitly state that conventional inventory management is not meaningful for AES and explain why (likely due to the nature of their business).\n   * Format numbers according to the provided guidelines (e.g., millions with 2 decimal places, percentages with 1 decimal place).\n   * If the inventory turnover ratio is 0, state \"nothing happened\".\n   * The final answer should include the calculated inventory turnover ratio.\n\n\n```\n\n*   Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) in FY2022: $8.80 billions\n*   Beginning Inventory (as of December 31, 2021): $604.00 millions\n*   Ending Inventory (as of December 31, 2022): $1055.00 millions\n*   Average Inventory: ($604.00 millions + $1055.00 millions) / 2 = $829.50 millions\n*   Inventory Turnover Ratio: $8.80 billions / $829.50 millions = 10.61\n\n**Final Answer:** The inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation in FY2022 is 10.61.\n\n\n",
