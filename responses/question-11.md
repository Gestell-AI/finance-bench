1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the ADOBE 2015 10K document. Specifically, examine the Statement of Cash Flows to find "Cash from operations" for FY2015 and the Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet) to find "Total Current Liabilities" for FY2015.

2. **Analysis and Calculations:**

* **Step 1: Locate Cash from Operations:** Find the value for "Cash from operations" in the Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal year 2015.  Let's assume this value is X.

* **Step 2: Locate Total Current Liabilities:** Find the value for "Total Current Liabilities" on the Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet) for the fiscal year 2015. Let's assume this value is Y.

* **Step 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:** Divide the value obtained in Step 1 ("Cash from operations," X) by the value obtained in Step 2 ("Total Current Liabilities," Y).

   Operating Cash Flow Ratio = X / Y

* **Step 4: Round the Result:** Round the calculated ratio to two decimal places.

3. **Response Rules:**

*   Format the final answer as a ratio with two decimal places (e.g., 1.23).
*   If either "Cash from operations" or "Total Current Liabilities" is not found in the specified financial statements, state that the calculation cannot be performed due to missing data.
*   The response should be concise and clearly present the calculated ratio.  No additional commentary is needed beyond the calculated value.

- Locate "Net cash provided by operating activities" in the 2015 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: $1469.5 millions
- Locate "Total current liabilities" in the 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheets: $2213.56 millions
- Divide cash from operations by current liabilities: $1469.5 millions / $2213.56 millions = 0.66
- Final Answer: 0.66

## Correct Answer

0.66
