1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the AMD 2022 10K document, specifically the sections describing AMD's business segments and product offerings.  This will likely be found in the "Business" or "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" sections.

2. **Analysis:**
   * Carefully read the descriptions of AMD's business segments (e.g., Computing and Graphics, Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom).
   * Identify the key product categories within each segment.  Look for specific product names or descriptions (e.g., Ryzen processors, Radeon graphics cards, EPYC server processors).
   * Note any significant services offered alongside the products (e.g., software support, design services).
   * Compile a list of the major product and service categories, avoiding overly granular detail.  Focus on the high-level offerings that represent the core of AMD's business.

3. **Response Rules:**
   * Present the major products and services as a concise, bulleted list.
   * Use clear and concise language, avoiding technical jargon where possible.
   * Do not include financial data or market share information unless explicitly mentioned in the 10K as a description of the product.
   * The response should be short and focused on answering the prompt directly.  No additional analysis or interpretation is needed.
   * The response should not include a final answer section as this is a descriptive question.
