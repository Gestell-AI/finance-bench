Correct document and section to analyze: 3M 2023Q2 10Q; specifically, the Statement of Cash Flows and the section detailing dividend payments.  Also, review the Income Statement for Net Income figures.\n\n2. Detailed analysis and calculations:\n\n* **Locate Dividends Distributed:** Find the total dividends paid to shareholders during the 2023Q2 period in the Statement of Cash Flows.  Note the amount.\n* **Locate Net Income:** Find the Net Income for the 2023Q2 period from the Income Statement. Note the amount.\n* **Find Previous Period's Dividends:** Locate the dividend payments for the previous fiscal periods (e.g., 2023Q1, 2022Q4, etc.) from the Statement of Cash Flows or relevant notes to the financial statements. Note the amounts.\n* **Calculate Percentage Change (Optional):** If multiple periods of dividend data are available, calculate the percentage change in dividend payments between consecutive periods using the formula: [(Current Period Dividends - Previous Period Dividends) / Previous Period Dividends] * 100%.\n* **Assess Stability:** Analyze the trend of dividend payments over the available periods.  A stable trend would show consistent or gradually increasing dividend payments with minimal fluctuations.  Consider both the absolute amounts and the percentage changes (if calculated).  If there are significant changes or inconsistencies, note them.  If no prior period data is available, state that a trend cannot be determined.\n\n3. Rules for responding:\n\n*   Present the findings in a concise, bulleted list.\n*   State the dividend amount for the 2023Q2 period.\n*   If sufficient data is available, present the dividend amounts for at least one prior period and calculate the percentage change between periods.\n*   Clearly state whether 3M maintains a stable trend of dividend distribution based on the analysis.  If the trend is not stable, describe the nature of the instability (e.g., significant increase, decrease, or fluctuation).\n*   If insufficient data is available to assess a trend, explicitly state this.\n*   Format all numerical values according to the provided guidelines.\n*   The final answer should state whether the trend is stable or not, and if not, describe the nature of the instability.\n\n```\n\nThe user is asking to determine if 3M has a stable dividend distribution trend based on the provided 2023Q2 10Q document.\n\nPlan:\n1.
