Correct document and section to analyze: Pfizer 2023Q2 10Q, specifically the sections detailing the Upjohn spin-off and any associated financial disclosures.  Look for sections discussing separation costs, transaction expenses, or similar terminology related to the spin-off.\n\n2. Detailed analysis and calculations:\n\n*   Carefully review the 10-Q for any explicit mention of future payments related to the Upjohn spin-off.  Look for tables or notes that break down the costs associated with the separation.\n*   The 10-Q may not provide a precise future payment amount.  If this is the case, look for ranges or estimates of future costs.  If only ranges are provided, state the range.\n*   If the document mentions any one-time events related to the spin-off, note them.  These could include legal fees, consulting fees, or other expenses directly attributable to the separation.\n*   If the document mentions any acquisitions or spin-offs, note them.  This will help to understand the context of the Upjohn spin-off and any related financial implications.\n*   If the document mentions any changes in accounting policies, note them.  This could affect how the spin-off costs are reported.\n*   If the document mentions any organic sales vs net sales, note them.  This will help to understand the context of the Upjohn spin-off and any related financial implications.\n*   If the document mentions any changes in working capital, note them.  This could affect the overall financial health of the company and be a key consideration in how the business can continue its operations.\n*   If no specific future payment amount is found, state that the document does not provide this information.\n\n3. Rules for responding:\n\n*   Present the findings in a concise, bullet-point format.\n*   If a specific dollar amount is found, report it in USD millions with two decimal places, following the specified formatting rules.\n*   If a range is provided, report the range in USD millions with two decimal places for each value.\n*   If no information is found, state that the document does not provide the requested information.\n*   Do not include any additional commentary or interpretation beyond the stated facts.\n*   The response should only include the amount in USD millions, as requested by the prompt.\n\n```\n\n* The provided document (Pfizer 2021 10K) details the *completed* spin-off of Upjohn, which occurred on November 16, 2020.  It does not project future spin-off costs.\n* The document mentions ongoing agreements with Viatris (the company formed from Upjohn and Mylan), including transition service agreements (TSAs) and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA).  However, no future payments related to these agreements are specified in the document.\n\n**Final Answer:** The 2021 10K does not provide the requested information on future payments related to the Upjohn spin-off.\n\n\n",
