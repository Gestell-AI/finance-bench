1. **Document and Section:** JPMorgan 2023Q2 10Q, section detailing Value at Risk (VaR) for the second fiscal quarter of 2023 and the same period in 2022.  This will likely be in the risk management section of the 10-Q filing.

2. **Analysis:**

* **Locate VaR Data:** Find the reported VaR figures for both Q2 2023 and Q2 2022.  The 10-Q should specify the time horizon (e.g., 1-day, 10-day VaR) and confidence level (e.g., 99%) used for the calculation.  If multiple VaR figures are presented (e.g., for different asset classes), focus on the overall VaR figure representing the total risk faced by JPMorgan.

* **Compare VaR Figures:**  Compare the VaR for Q2 2023 to the VaR for Q2 2022.

* **Calculate Percentage Change:** Determine the percentage change in VaR using the following formula:

   `Percentage Change = [(VaR_Q2_2023 - VaR_Q2_2022) / VaR_Q2_2022] * 100`

* **Interpret Results:** If the percentage change is negative, the risk faced by JPMorgan decreased. If it's positive, the risk increased. If it's zero, the risk remained unchanged.  Note the magnitude of the change to provide context.

3. **Response Rules:**

*   Follow the formatting guidelines specified in the `Response Instructions` section.
*   Present the Q2 2023 and Q2 2022 VaR figures.
*   Clearly state the percentage change in VaR.
*   Concisely answer whether the risk decreased, increased, or remained unchanged, based on the percentage change calculation.  If the change is zero, explicitly state that "nothing happened".
*   Use bullet points to structure the response.
*   The final answer should include both the dollar and percentage changes in VaR.


```

- Average Total VaR for Q2 2023: $47 millions
- Average Total VaR for Q2 2022: $54 millions
- Change in VaR: Decrease in $7 millions
- Percentage Change in VaR: (47-54)/54 = -12.9%

**Final Answer:** VaR decreased by $7 millions (-12.9%)

## Correct Answer

Yes. It decreased.
