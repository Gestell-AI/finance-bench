Correct document and section to analyze: ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD 2019 10K, Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of Income.\n\n2. Detailed analysis and calculations:\n\n*   **Step 1: Extract relevant data from the 10K.** Locate the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of Income for fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019. Extract the following data for each year:\n    *   Capital Expenditures (CapEx): This will be found in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows.\n    *   Revenue (Total Revenues): This will be found in the statement of income.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the annual CapEx as a percentage of revenue.** For each year, divide the CapEx by the revenue and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.  For example:\n    *   FY2017: (CapEx FY2017 / Revenue FY2017) * 100 = Percentage for FY2017\n    *   FY2018: (CapEx FY2018 / Revenue FY2018) * 100 = Percentage for FY2018\n    *   FY2019: (CapEx FY2019 / Revenue FY2019) * 100 = Percentage for FY2019\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the 3-year average.** Sum the percentages calculated in Step 2 for FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019. Then divide the sum by 3 to obtain the average.\n\n*   **Step 4: Round to one decimal place.** Round the final average percentage to one decimal place as per the prompt's instructions.\n\n\n3. Response rules:\n\n*   The response should be a concise markdown list.\n*   Each step of the calculation should be clearly shown.\n*   The final answer should be presented as a percentage rounded to one decimal place.  For example: \"The 3-year average of CapEx as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard from FY2017 to FY2019 is X.X%\".\n*   If any of the required data is missing from the 10K, clearly state this in the response.\n*   Follow all formatting instructions specified in the `Response Instructions` section of the provided text.\n\n```\n\nThe user is asking for the 3-year average of capital expenditures (capex) as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard, spanning fiscal years 2017 to 2019.
