Focus on the financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Statement of Cash Flows) for the fiscal year 2022.  Pay close attention to sections discussing key performance indicators and management's discussion and analysis.\n\n2. **Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n* **Revenue Growth:** Calculate the revenue growth rate for FY2022 compared to FY2021.  Obtain revenue figures from the income statement.  Growth Rate = [(FY2022 Revenue - FY2021 Revenue) / FY2021 Revenue] * 100%.  Compare this growth rate to industry benchmarks for high-growth companies in the pharmaceutical sector.\n\n* **EBITDA Growth:** Calculate the EBITDA growth rate for FY2022 compared to FY2021. Obtain Net Income, Taxes, Interest Expense, and Depreciation & Amortization from the income statement. Use the formula: EBITDA = Net Income + Taxes + Interest Expense + D&A.  Calculate the growth rate using the same formula as revenue growth. Compare this to industry benchmarks.\n\n* **Profitability Ratios:** Calculate key profitability ratios such as Net Profit Margin, Gross Profit Margin, and Return on Assets (ROA) for FY2022.  Compare these ratios to industry averages for high-growth companies.  High-growth companies often exhibit higher profit margins than established companies.\n\n* **Free Cash Flow Growth:** Calculate the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for FY2022 and FY2021 using the formula provided in the instructions. Analyze the growth rate of FCFE.  High-growth companies typically demonstrate strong and increasing free cash flow.\n\n* **Capital Expenditures (CapEx):** Analyze CapEx as a percentage of revenue for FY2022.  High-growth companies may have higher CapEx as a percentage of revenue due to investments in expansion.\n\n* **Qualitative Factors:** Review the management's discussion and analysis section of the 10K for qualitative insights into the company's growth strategy, market position, and future outlook.  Look for statements about growth initiatives, market share gains, and expectations for future performance.  Consider any one-time events, spin-offs, or acquisitions that may have impacted the financials.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Present the calculated growth rates for revenue and EBITDA as percentages with one decimal place.\n*   Present profitability ratios with one decimal place.\n*   Present the CapEx/Revenue ratio as a percentage with zero decimal places.\n*   Summarize the qualitative factors from the management discussion and analysis.\n*   Conclude with a statement indicating whether JNJ's FY2022 financials align with those of a high-growth company based on the quantitative and qualitative analysis.  If the analysis shows mixed results, clearly state this.  The final answer should include both the $ and % changes where applicable.  If there is no change, state \"nothing happened\".  The response should be concise and use bullet points.\n\n```\n\n* **2022 Revenue:** $94.90 billions\n* **2021 Revenue:** $93.70 billions\n* **Revenue Change:** $94.90 billions - $93.70 billions = $1.20 billions\n* **Revenue Growth:** ($1.20 billions / $93.70 billions) * 100 = 1.3%\n\n* **2022 Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income:** $21.7 billions\n* **2021 Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income:** $22.8 billions\n* **Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Change:** $21.7 billions- $22.8 billions = decrease in $1.1 billions\n* **Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Growth:** (decrease in $1.1 billions / $22.8 billions) * 100 = -4.8%\n\n* **Cost of products sold increased** as a percent to sales driven by one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs, currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment, and commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments, partially offset by supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment.\n* **Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses decreased** as a percent to sales driven by a reduction of brand marketing expenses in the Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses.\n\n**Final Answer:** JnJ's FY2022 financials do not reflect those of a high-growth company. Revenue increased by $1.20 billions (1.3%), while Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income decreased by $1.1 billions (-4.8%).  Several factors contributed to these changes, including one-time costs, currency impacts, and commodity inflation.\n\n\n",
