  "prompt": "In the document PFIZER 2021 10K, Did Pfizer grow its PPNE between FY20 and FY21?",
  "response": "```results\n[\n  {\n    \"citation\": \"Filename: PFIZER_2021_10K.pdf, pages: 87-88\",\n    \"reason\": \"Gestell selected this node for containing PP&E values for both FY20 and FY21, allowing for a growth comparison.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n```cot\n1. Analyze document: PFIZER 2021 10K.  Specifically, locate the balance sheets for fiscal years 2020 (FY20) and 2021 (FY21).  Find the \"Property, Plant, and Equipment\" (PP&E) values for both years.\n\n2.  Perform Calculation:\n\n*   **Step 1:** Identify the PP&E value for FY20 from the balance sheet. Let's say this value is X.\n*   **Step 2:** Identify the PP&E value for FY21 from the balance sheet. Let's say this value is Y.\n*   **Step 3:** Calculate the change in PP&E:  Δ PP&E = Y - X\n*   **Step 4:** Calculate the percentage change in PP&E: [(Y - X) / X] * 100%\n\n3. Response Rules:\n\n*   Present the findings as a concise bullet point list.\n*   State the PP&E values for FY20 and FY21.\n*   Report the absolute change (Δ PP&E) in dollars, following the specified formatting rules (millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero).  If the change is a decrease, use \"decrease in $value\" format.\n*   Report the percentage change in PP&E, formatted to one decimal place.\n*   If the change in PP&E is zero, explicitly state \"Pfizer did not grow its PPNE between FY20 and FY21\".\n\n\n```\n\n*   FY20 PP&E: $13745.00 millions\n*   FY21 PP&E: $14882.00 millions\n*   Change in PP&E: $1137.00 millions\n*   Percentage Change in PP&E: 8.3%\n\n**Final Answer:** Pfizer's PP&E increased by $1137.00 millions (8.3%) between FY20 and FY21.\n\n\n",
  "answer": "Yes, change in PPNE was positive year over year",
