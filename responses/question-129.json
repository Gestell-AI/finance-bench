Focus on the sections discussing the company's updated full-year guidance for FY2023 and the reasons provided for the increase.  Look for statements explaining the rationale behind the upward revision.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n   Carefully examine the document for statements explaining the reasons behind the increased guidance.  Look for specific factors cited by PepsiCo management, such as:\n    * **Stronger-than-expected Q1 performance:** Did the company exceed its initial Q1 projections?  If so, this would likely be a key reason for raising full-year guidance.\n    * **Improved market conditions:** Did PepsiCo experience positive shifts in market demand, pricing power, or reduced input costs?  These factors could justify increased optimism for the remainder of the year.\n    * **Successful new product launches or marketing campaigns:**  Did any new initiatives contribute significantly to revenue growth?\n    * **Cost-cutting measures:** Did PepsiCo implement successful cost-reduction strategies that improved profitability?\n    * **Changes in foreign exchange rates:**  Did favorable currency movements positively impact earnings?\n    * **Acquisitions or divestitures:** Did any mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures influence the outlook?\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n    * Summarize the reasons provided in the document for the increased guidance in concise bullet points.\n    * Do not speculate on reasons not explicitly mentioned in the document.\n    * If no reasons are explicitly stated, indicate that the document does not provide an explanation.\n    * Use the specified formatting rules for numbers and currency.  The response should be short, concise, and clearly formatted in markdown.  The final answer should not include a calculation, but rather a summary of the reasons given in the document.\n\n```\n\n* PepsiCo raised its FY2023 organic revenue growth guidance from 6% to 8%.\n* PepsiCo raised its FY2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance from 8% to 9%.\n* The company cited a \"strong start to the year\" as the reason for the increased guidance.\n* Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta stated that the company's categories and geographies remained resilient during the first quarter.\n\n**Final Answer:** PepsiCo raised its FY2023 guidance due to stronger-than-anticipated Q1 performance and resilient categories and geographies.  The organic revenue growth outlook increased by 2% (from 6% to 8%), and core constant currency EPS growth outlook increased by 1% (from 8% to 9%).\n\n\n",
