Analyze document: AES 2022 10K, specifically the Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Income for fiscal years 2021 and 2022.\n\n2. Detailed Analysis and Calculations:\n\n* **Step 1: Locate FY2022 Net Income:** Find the net income for fiscal year 2022 from the statement of income.  Let's assume this value is represented by 'Net Income_2022'.\n\n* **Step 2: Locate Total Assets for FY2021 and FY2022:** Obtain the total assets for both fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2022 from the statement of financial position. Let's represent these values as 'Total Assets_2021' and 'Total Assets_2022' respectively.\n\n* **Step 3: Calculate Average Total Assets:** Compute the average total assets between FY2021 and FY2022 using the formula:  Average Total Assets = (Total Assets_2021 + Total Assets_2022) / 2\n\n* **Step 4: Calculate Return on Assets (ROA):**  Divide the FY2022 net income by the average total assets calculated in Step 3.  ROA = Net Income_2022 / Average Total Assets.\n\n* **Step 5: Round the Result:** Round the calculated ROA to two decimal places.\n\n\n3. Response Rules:\n\n*   Format the final ROA value to two decimal places.\n*   If the calculated ROA is 0, state \"nothing happened\".\n*   Present the final answer concisely as a single numerical value.  Do not include percentage signs or dollar signs.\n*   Use a minus sign to indicate a negative value.\n\n\n```\n\n* **FY2022 Net Income:** $(505) million (AES_2022_10K.pdf, page 133)\n* **FY2021 Total Assets:** $26599 million (AES_2022_10K.pdf, page 131)\n* **FY2022 Total Assets:** $28073 million (AES_2022_10K.pdf, page 131)\n* **Average Total Assets:** ($26599 million + $28073 million) / 2 = $27336 million\n* **ROA:** $(505) million / $27336 million = -0.02\n\n**Final Answer:** -0.02\n\n\n",
