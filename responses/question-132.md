Analyze the "PFIZER 2021 10K" document, specifically focusing on the sections detailing the company's financial statements for 2019 and any accompanying notes or disclosures that discuss non-recurring or unusual items impacting net income.

*   Carefully review the 2019 financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and notes) to identify any significant increases in net income compared to previous years.
*   Identify any items explicitly labeled as non-recurring, unusual, or one-time events.  These are often disclosed separately in the notes to the financial statements.
