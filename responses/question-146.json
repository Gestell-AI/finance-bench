Specifically, focus on the sections providing data for Capital Expenditures (CapEx), Revenue, Total Assets, and Fixed Assets for Fiscal Year 2022.\n\n2. **Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n* **Step 1: Find CapEx and Revenue:** Locate the Verizon 2022 10K's statement of cash flows or a similar financial statement to find the CapEx for FY2022.  Also, find the total revenue for FY2022 from the income statement.\n\n* **Step 2: Calculate CapEx/Revenue Ratio:** Divide the CapEx by the Revenue.  Convert the result to a percentage by multiplying by 100. Round to the nearest whole number.\n\n* **Step 3: Find Total Assets and Fixed Assets:** Locate the balance sheet to find the values for Total Assets and Fixed Assets (Property, Plant, and Equipment - PP&E) at the end of FY2022.\n\n* **Step 4: Calculate Fixed Assets/Total Assets Ratio:** Divide the Fixed Assets by the Total Assets. Convert the result to a percentage by multiplying by 100. Round to the nearest whole number.\n\n* **Step 5: Calculate Return on Assets (ROA):**  Determine Net Income for FY2022 from the income statement. Calculate ROA by dividing Net Income by Total Assets. Convert the result to a percentage by multiplying by 100. Round to the nearest whole number.\n\n* **Step 6: Assess Capital Intensity:** Based on the three calculated ratios (CapEx/Revenue, Fixed Assets/Total Assets, and ROA), determine if Verizon is capital-intensive.  High CapEx/Revenue and Fixed Assets/Total Assets ratios, coupled with a relatively low ROA, would suggest capital intensiveness.  Consider industry benchmarks for comparison if available within the 10K or from external sources.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n* Present the three calculated ratios (CapEx/Revenue ratio, Fixed Assets/Total Assets ratio, and ROA) as percentages rounded to 0 decimal places.\n* State whether Verizon is capital-intensive based on the analysis of these three ratios, providing a concise explanation.  If the ratios are inconclusive, state that more information is needed for a definitive assessment.\n* Follow the specified formatting rules for numbers (dollar amounts, percentages, and ratios).\n* The final answer should be a clear statement about whether Verizon is capital-intensive in FY2022, supported by the calculated ratios.  If the data is insufficient to make a determination, state this clearly.\n\n\n```\n\n* **CapEx:** Verizon's capital expenditures for FY2022 were $23.10 billion.\n* **Revenue:** Verizon's total revenue for FY2022 was $136.84 billion.\n* **CapEx/Revenue Ratio:** ($23.10 billion / $136.84 billion) * 100 = 17%\n\n* **Fixed Assets (Net PP&E):** $107.43 billion\n* **Total Assets:** $379.68 billion\n* **Fixed Assets/Total Assets Ratio:** ($107.43 billion / $379.68 billion) * 100 = 28%\n\n* **Net Income:** $21.75 billion\n* **Return on Assets (ROA):** ($21.75 billion / $379.68 billion) * 100 = 6%\n\n**Final Answer:** Verizon demonstrates characteristics of a capital-intensive business in FY2022.  This assessment is based on its CapEx/Revenue ratio of 17%, Fixed Assets/Total Assets ratio of 28%, and a relatively modest ROA of 6%.  The high proportion of fixed assets and significant capital expenditures relative to revenue indicate substantial investment in infrastructure, while the ROA suggests a lower return on these investments compared to potentially less capital-intensive industries.\n\n\n",
  "answer": "Yes. Verizon's capital intensity ratio was approximately 2.774729. This means that it took approximately $2.77 of assets to generate $1 of revenue and thus, Verizon can be considered capital intensive.",
