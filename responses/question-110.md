1. Correct document and section to analyze: MGMRESORTS 2023Q2 10Q, specifically the section detailing short-term investments in the financial statements.  This will likely be within the balance sheet or notes to the financial statements.

2. Detailed analysis and calculations:

*   Locate the section of the 10-Q that lists MGM's short-term investments.  This section will likely provide a breakdown of the types of short-term investments held (e.g., corporate bonds, commercial paper, etc.) and their respective values.
*   Identify the value of each type of short-term investment.
*   Calculate the percentage of the total short-term investments represented by each type of investment.  This is done by dividing the value of each type of investment by the total value of all short-term investments and multiplying by 100%.
*   Determine which type of short-term investment has the highest percentage.  This will be the type of debt that received the largest investment.
*   The final answer should state the type of short-term investment with the highest percentage and the percentage itself.  The response should follow the formatting guidelines provided in the "Response Instructions" section.

3. Rules for responding:

*   Follow the specified formatting rules for dollar values, percentages, and ratios.
*   Present the final answer as a concise bullet point, clearly stating the type of short-term investment and its percentage of the total.
*   If the percentage is close to 82%, the response should reflect this approximation.
*   If no short-term investments are listed, the response should state that no information is available.
