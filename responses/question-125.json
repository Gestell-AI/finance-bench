Specifically, focus on the Statement of Cash Flows and the Profit & Loss (P&L) statement to extract the necessary data for EBITDA calculation.\n\n2. **Detailed Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n   * **Step 1: Locate Unadjusted Operating Income:** Find the \"Unadjusted Operating Income\" figure from the P&L statement for FY2022.  Let's assume this value is X.\n\n   * **Step 2: Locate Depreciation and Amortization (D&A):** Find the \"Depreciation and Amortization\" figure from the Statement of Cash Flows for FY2022. Let's assume this value is Y.\n\n   * **Step 3: Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA:** Use the formula:  Unadjusted EBITDA = Unadjusted Operating Income + D&A.  Therefore, Unadjusted EBITDA = X + Y. Let's assume the result is Z.\n\n   * **Step 4: Locate Net Revenue (or Total Revenues):** Find the \"Net Revenue\" or \"Total Revenues\" figure from the P&L statement for FY2022. Let's assume this value is W.\n\n   * **Step 5: Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA Margin:** Use the formula: Unadjusted EBITDA Margin = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Net Revenue) * 100.  Therefore, Unadjusted EBITDA Margin = (Z / W) * 100.  This will give the percentage margin. Let's assume the result is P%.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n   * Present the final answer as a bullet point.\n   * Format the Unadjusted EBITDA as a dollar value according to the specified formatting rules (millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero).\n   * Format the Unadjusted EBITDA Margin as a percentage with 1 decimal place.\n   * If the calculated values are zero, state \"nothing happened\".  The response should clearly indicate if there was no change.\n\n\n```\n\n*   **Locate Unadjusted Operating Profit:** The 2022 10K (page 40) lists PepsiCo's operating profit as $11512 million.\n\n*   **Locate Depreciation and Amortization:**  The 2022 10K (page 74) lists PepsiCo's total depreciation and amortization as $2685 million. It also lists amortization of intangible assets as $78 million. Total D&A is $2685 + $78 = $2763 million.\n\n*   **Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA:** Unadjusted EBITDA = Operating Profit + D&A = $11512 million + $2763 million = $14275 million\n\n*   **Locate Net Revenue:** The 2022 10K (page 40) lists PepsiCo's net revenue as $86392 million.\n\n*   **Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA Margin:** Unadjusted EBITDA Margin = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Net Revenue) * 100 = ($14275 million / $86392 million) * 100 = 16.5%\n\n**Final Answer:** $14275.00 million, 16.5%\n\n\n",
