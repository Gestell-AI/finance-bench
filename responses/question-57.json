Specifically, focus on the balance sheet for the fiscal year 2016.  Locate the values for \"Total Current Assets\" and \"Total Current Liabilities\".\n\n2. **Analysis and Calculation:**\n\n* **Step 1: Locate Total Current Assets:** Find the value reported for \"Total Current Assets\" on Block's FY2016 balance sheet. Let's assume this value is X.\n* **Step 2: Locate Total Current Liabilities:** Find the value reported for \"Total Current Liabilities\" on Block's FY2016 balance sheet. Let's assume this value is Y.\n* **Step 3: Calculate Working Capital Ratio:** Divide Total Current Assets (X) by Total Current Liabilities (Y).\n    * Working Capital Ratio = X / Y\n* **Step 4: Round the Result:** Round the calculated ratio to two decimal places.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Format the final answer as a ratio with two decimal places (e.g., 1.23).\n*   The response should be a concise bullet point list showing the steps and the final calculated ratio.  No additional commentary is needed.\n*   If the values for Total Current Assets or Total Current Liabilities are not available in the document, state that the calculation cannot be performed due to missing data.\n\n\n```\n\n* Locate Total Current Assets for FY2016: $1,001,425 thousands\n* Locate Total Current Liabilities for FY2016: $577,464 thousands\n* Calculate Working Capital Ratio: $1,001,425/$577,464 = 1.73\n\n**Final Answer:** 1.73\n\n\n",
