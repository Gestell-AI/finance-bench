Include the values obtained from the 10K for Net Income and Net Revenue for each year.\n\n```\n\n* **FY2015:**\n    * Net Income: $1,233 million\n    * Revenue: $40,339 million\n    * Net Profit Margin: ($1,233 / $40,339) * 100 = 3.1%\n\n* **FY2016:**\n    * Net Income: $897 million\n    * Revenue: $39,528 million\n    * Net Profit Margin: ($897 / $39,528) * 100 = 2.3%\n\n* **FY2017:**\n    * Net Income: $1,228 million\n    * Revenue: $39,403 million\n    * Net Profit Margin: ($1,228 / $39,403) * 100 = 3.1%\n\n* **3-Year Average Net Profit Margin:** (3.1% + 2.3% + 3.1%) / 3 = 2.8%\n\n**Final Answer:** 2.8%\n\n\n",
