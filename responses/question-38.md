1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the AMD 2022 10K document, specifically the sections discussing risk factors, business overview, and the MD&A (Management Discussion and Analysis).  Focus on sections related to customer concentration, sales, and revenue breakdowns.

2. **Analysis:**
   * **Search for keywords:** Search the document for keywords such as "customer concentration," "top customers," "revenue concentration," "key accounts," "customer diversification," and similar terms.
   * **Examine risk factors:** The risk factors section often highlights potential risks associated with customer concentration. Look for statements indicating reliance on a small number of customers or the potential negative impact of losing a major customer.
   * **Review MD&A:** The MD&A section usually provides a detailed discussion of the company's performance, including revenue breakdowns by customer segment or product line.  Look for any information that reveals the proportion of revenue derived from a small number of customers.  Pay close attention to any quantitative data provided (e.g., percentages of revenue from top customers).
   * **Analyze financial statements:** While less likely to explicitly state "customer concentration," the financial statements might indirectly reveal it. For example, a significant drop in revenue in a particular year could be investigated to determine if it was due to the loss of a major customer.

3. **Response Rules:**
   * If the 10K explicitly states that AMD reported customer concentration in FY22, provide a concise summary of the reported concentration, including any quantitative data (percentages, number of top customers, etc.) and qualitative descriptions.  Format numbers according to the provided guidelines.
   * If the 10K does not explicitly mention customer concentration, but the analysis reveals indirect evidence (e.g., high reliance on a few customers based on revenue breakdowns or risk factor discussions), state this, providing the evidence found.
   * If the 10K contains no information about customer concentration, state that "AMD did not report customer concentration in FY22."
   * Format the response as a short, concise, clear breakdown using bullet points.  The final answer should clearly state whether AMD reported customer concentration and, if so, provide the details.  If not, state that nothing was reported.

```

- The 10K filing explicitly states that losing this customer would have a material adverse effect on AMD's business.
- Two customers combined accounted for more than 10% of AMD's consolidated net revenue in FY22.

**Final Answer:** AMD reported customer concentration in FY22, with one customer representing 16% of total revenue. Losing this customer would have a material adverse effect on the business.
