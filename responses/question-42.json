Analyze the sections discussing gross margin and the overall financial performance of American Express.  Specifically, look for discussions of revenue, cost of revenue, and any explanations provided for changes in gross margin or why it might not be a useful metric for this type of company.\n\n2. **Analysis:** The provided `Search Result Instructions` do not contain a method for calculating or analyzing gross margin.  However, it does state: \"You cannot assess performance using this metric\".  Therefore, the analysis should focus on why gross margin is not a useful metric for assessing American Express's performance.  This will require examining the nature of American Express's business (a financial services company, specifically credit cards and payment processing).  The analysis should explain that gross margin, which focuses on the relationship between revenue and direct costs of goods sold, is less relevant for a service-based company like American Express than for a company that manufactures and sells physical goods.  American Express's primary costs are likely to be operating expenses (salaries, technology, marketing, etc.), not direct costs of goods sold.  Therefore, focusing on metrics like operating income, net income, or return on equity would provide a more accurate picture of the company's financial health.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Follow the formatting rules specified in the `Response Instructions`.\n*   The response should begin by stating that gross margin is not a useful metric for assessing American Express's performance.\n*   Explain why gross margin is unsuitable for a service-based company like American Express, emphasizing the difference between direct costs of goods sold (relevant for gross margin) and operating expenses (more relevant for a financial services company).\n*   The response should not attempt to calculate a gross margin change.\n*   The response should be concise and presented as bullet points.\n*   There will be no $ or % changes to report as the metric is not applicable.\n*   The final answer will state that gross margin is not a useful metric for American Express and explain why.\n\n\n```\n\n* Gross margin is not a useful metric for assessing the performance of American Express.\n* American Express is primarily a financial services company, focusing on credit cards, payment processing, and other financial products.\n* Gross margin is typically used to analyze companies that manufacture and sell physical goods. It represents the difference between revenue and the direct cost of goods sold.\n* Service-based companies like American Express do not have a significant \"cost of goods sold\" in the same way as manufacturing companies.  Their primary costs are operating expenses such as salaries, technology, marketing, and card member rewards.\n* For American Express, analyzing operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and return on equity provides a more meaningful assessment of financial performance than gross margin.\n\n**Final Answer:** Gross margin is not a useful metric for American Express because it is a service-based company whose costs are primarily operating expenses, not cost of goods sold.  Therefore, there is no gross margin change to report.\n\n\n",
