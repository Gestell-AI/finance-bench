- FY2022:
  - Net Sales: $10.20 billions
  - SG&A: $2.39 billions
  - SG&A as a percentage of Net Sales: 23.5% ($2.39 billions / $10.20 billions \* 100)
- FY2023:

  - Net Sales: $11.00 billions (Average of $10.95 and $11.05 billion)
  - SG&A: $2.57 billions (Average of $10.95 billion _ 14.7% and $11.05 billion _ 15%)
  - SG&A as a percentage of Net Sales: 23.4% ($2.57 billions / $11.00 billions \* 100)

- Change in SG&A as a percentage of Net Sales: -0.1% (23.4% - 23.5%)

**Final Answer:** SG&A as a percent of net sales decreased by 0.1% driven by leverage of marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments and deleverage in corporate overhead due to strategic investments.
