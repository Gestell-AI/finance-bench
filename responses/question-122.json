Specifically, focus on the section detailing legal proceedings or litigation within the \"Risk Factors\" or \"Legal Proceedings\" section (the exact section title may vary slightly).  If neither section exists, check the notes to the financial statements.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n    * **Identify Legal Battles:** Carefully review the designated section for descriptions of ongoing legal battles.  Look for details on the nature of the lawsuits, the parties involved, and any material impact on PepsiCo's financial position or operations.\n    * **Materiality Assessment:** Determine if any described legal battles are considered \"materially important.\"  A legal battle is materially important if it has a significant impact on PepsiCo's financial statements, operations, or future prospects. Consider factors such as potential financial penalties, reputational damage, or disruption to business activities.  Consider both FY2021 and FY2022.\n    * **FY2021 and FY2022 Distinction:**  Pay close attention to whether the legal battles are ongoing from both fiscal years.  Some cases might have started in FY2021 and continued into FY2022.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n    * **Format:** Use bullet points to list each materially important ongoing legal battle.  For each battle, provide a concise description of the case and its potential impact.\n    * **Materiality:** Only include legal battles deemed materially important based on the analysis in step 2.\n    * **No Battles:** If no materially important ongoing legal battles are found, state: \"PepsiCo did not report any materially important ongoing legal battles from FY2021 and FY2022.\"\n    * **Conciseness:** Keep the response brief and to the point, focusing on the key facts of each legal battle.  Avoid unnecessary details.\n\n\n```\n\n* PepsiCo faces various legal proceedings, claims, inquiries, and investigations.  These include matters related to advertising and marketing practices, product labeling, ingredients, personal injury, property damage, intellectual property rights, privacy, employment, tax, insurance, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters, and compliance with laws and regulations.  Management believes that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on PepsiCo's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  This assessment was consistent across both FY2021 and FY2022.\n\n**Final Answer:** PepsiCo did not report any *materially important* ongoing legal battles from FY2021 and FY2022.\n\n\n",
