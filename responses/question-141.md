1. Correct document to analyze: ULTABEAUTY 2023Q4 EARNINGS.  The relevant sections will be those detailing stock repurchases for both Q4 2023 and the full fiscal year 2023.

2. Detailed Analysis and Calculations:

* **Locate Q4 2023 Stock Repurchases:** Find the amount spent on stock repurchases during the fourth quarter (Q4) of fiscal year 2023 within the document. Let's assume this value is represented by the variable `Q4_Repurchases`.

* **Locate FY 2023 Stock Repurchases:** Find the total amount spent on stock repurchases for the entire fiscal year 2023 (FY2023).  Let's assume this value is represented by the variable `FY2023_Repurchases`.

* **Calculate the Percentage:**  Compute the percentage of FY2023 stock repurchases that occurred in Q4 by using the following formula:

   `(Q4_Repurchases / FY2023_Repurchases) * 100%`

* **Round to the Nearest Whole Number:** Round the resulting percentage to the nearest whole number as per the prompt's instructions.

3. Response Rules:

*   The response should be a single sentence stating the percentage of Ulta Beauty's total stock repurchases for FY2023 that occurred in Q4 of FY2023.  The percentage should be a whole number without decimals.
*   If the calculated percentage is 0%, the response should state "Nothing happened".
*   The response should not include any additional information or analysis beyond the requested percentage.
*   The response should explicitly state the assumption that FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023, if that assumption is made based on the document's information.


```

- The document states that during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Ulta Beauty repurchased $328.1 million worth of stock.
- For the full fiscal year 2022, the company repurchased $900.0 million worth of stock.
- To calculate the percentage of total stock repurchases that occurred in Q4, divide the Q4 repurchases by the total fiscal year repurchases and multiply by 100: ($328.1 million / $900.0 million) \* 100 = 36.455...%
- Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us 36%.

Final Answer: 36%. The answer here assumes FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023.

## Correct Answer

36%. The answer here assumes FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023 (although the company refers to this period as its fiscal 2022.
