Correct document to analyze: ULTABEAUTY 2023Q4 EARNINGS.  The relevant sections will be those detailing stock repurchases for both Q4 2023 and the full fiscal year 2023.\n\n2. Detailed Analysis and Calculations:\n\n* **Locate Q4 2023 Stock Repurchases:** Find the amount spent on stock repurchases during the fourth quarter (Q4) of fiscal year 2023 within the document. Let's assume this value is represented by the variable `Q4_Repurchases`.\n\n* **Locate FY 2023 Stock Repurchases:** Find the total amount spent on stock repurchases for the entire fiscal year 2023 (FY2023).  Let's assume this value is represented by the variable `FY2023_Repurchases`.\n\n* **Calculate the Percentage:**  Compute the percentage of FY2023 stock repurchases that occurred in Q4 by using the following formula:\n\n   `(Q4_Repurchases / FY2023_Repurchases) * 100%`\n\n* **Round to the Nearest Whole Number:** Round the resulting percentage to the nearest whole number as per the prompt's instructions.\n\n3. Response Rules:\n\n*   The response should be a single sentence stating the percentage of Ulta Beauty's total stock repurchases for FY2023 that occurred in Q4 of FY2023.  The percentage should be a whole number without decimals.\n*   If the calculated percentage is 0%, the response should state \"Nothing happened\".\n*   The response should not include any additional information or analysis beyond the requested percentage.\n*   The response should explicitly state the assumption that FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023, if that assumption is made based on the document's information.\n\n\n```\n\n* The document states that during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Ulta Beauty repurchased $328.1 million worth of stock.\n* For the full fiscal year 2022, the company repurchased $900.0 million worth of stock.\n* To calculate the percentage of total stock repurchases that occurred in Q4, divide the Q4 repurchases by the total fiscal year repurchases and multiply by 100: ($328.1 million / $900.0 million) * 100 = 36.455...%\n* Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us 36%.\n\nFinal Answer: 36%. The answer here assumes FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023.\n\n\n",
