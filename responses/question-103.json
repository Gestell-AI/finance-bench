Specifically, focus on the Statement of Income for fiscal years 2020 and 2022 to extract the total revenue figures.\n\n2. **Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n   * **Step 1: Extract Revenue Data:** Locate the total revenue figures for fiscal years 2020 and 2022 from the Statement of Income. Let's assume (replace with actual values from the 10K):\n      * FY2020 Total Revenue = $65000.00 millions\n      * FY2022 Total Revenue = $74000.00 millions\n\n   * **Step 2: Calculate the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR):** Use the following formula to calculate the 2-year CAGR:\n\n     CAGR = [(Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of years)] - 1\n\n     In this case:\n\n     CAGR = [($74000.00 millions / $65000.00 millions)^(1 / 2)] - 1\n\n     CAGR = [1.13846^(0.5)] - 1\n\n     CAGR = 1.06708 - 1\n\n     CAGR = 0.06708\n\n   * **Step 3: Convert to Percentage:** Multiply the CAGR by 100 to express it as a percentage:\n\n     CAGR (%) = 0.06708 * 100 = 6.7%\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n   * Format the final CAGR as a percentage with one decimal place (6.7%).\n   * The response should be concise and clearly state the 2-year total revenue CAGR from FY2020 to FY2022.  \n   * If the CAGR is 0, state \"Nothing happened\".\n   * The response should be in bullet points.\n\n   *Example Response:*\n\n   * Lockheed Martin's FY2020 Total Revenue: $65000.00 millions\n   * Lockheed Martin's FY2022 Total Revenue: $74000.00 millions\n   * Calculation: (($74000.00 millions / $65000.00 millions)^(1/2)) -1 = 0.06708\n   * 2-Year Revenue CAGR: 6.7%\n\n\n```\n\n* Lockheed Martin's FY2020 Total Revenue: $65398.00 millions\n* Lockheed Martin's FY2022 Total Revenue: $65984.00 millions\n* Calculation: (($65984.00 millions / $65398.00 millions)^(1/2)) - 1 = 0.00436\n* 2-Year Revenue CAGR: 0.4%\n\n**Final Answer:** 0.4%\n\n\n",
