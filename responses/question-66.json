  "response": "```results\n[\n  {\n    \"citation\": \"Filename: BOEING_2022_10K.pdf, pages: 33\",\n    \"reason\": \"Gestell selected this node for containing information on Boeing's 737 program performance in 2022, including production rates, and plans for further increases based on market demand and supply chain capacity.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"citation\": \"Filename: BOEING_2022_10K.pdf, pages: 34-35\",\n    \"reason\": \"Gestell selected this node for its details on Boeing's various aircraft programs (737 MAX, 767, 777/777X, 787) and production plans, including a planned increase to 5 787s per month in 2023.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n```cot\n1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the BOEING 2022 10K document. Focus on sections discussing production forecasts or outlook for FY2023.  Look for management discussion and analysis (MD&A) sections, as well as any specific press releases or statements included within the 10K.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n   * **Locate Production Rate Information:** Carefully review the 10K for any explicit statements regarding Boeing's planned production rate changes for the 737, 787, and other aircraft models in FY2023.  Pay close attention to numerical data presented in tables or charts.\n   * **Identify Units and Timeframes:**  Ensure that any identified production rates are clearly specified in terms of units (e.g., aircraft per month, aircraft per quarter, aircraft per year) and the relevant timeframe (FY2023).\n   * **Contextualize Changes:**  If production rate changes are mentioned, analyze the surrounding text to understand the reasons behind the changes (e.g., increased demand, supply chain issues, production improvements).  Note any qualitative descriptions of the changes (e.g., \"increase,\" \"decrease,\" \"stable\").\n   * **Handle Uncertainty:** If the 10K provides a range of possible production rates or uses conditional language (e.g., \"plans to,\" \"expects to\"), clearly state the uncertainty in the response.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n   * **Format:** Present the findings as concise bullet points.\n   * **Clarity:** Use plain English, avoiding jargon.\n   * **Precision:**  State the production rate changes with the correct units and timeframe.\n   * **Uncertainty:** If the 10K doesn't provide precise figures or expresses uncertainty, clearly state this.\n   * **No Calculations:** This prompt does not require calculations; it's about extracting information.\n   * **Final Answer:** The final answer will be a summary of Boeing's production rate forecasts for FY2023, broken down by aircraft model if possible, including any stated uncertainty.  If no specific production rate changes are mentioned, the response should state that no changes were explicitly forecast.\n\n```\n\n* **737 Program:** Boeing increased the 737 production rate to 31 per month in 2022 and expects further gradual production rate increases in 2023 based on market demand and supply chain capacity.  No specific target rate is given.\n* **777X Program:**  777X-9 production is paused during 2022 and 2023.  Production is expected to resume after this period, but no specific rate is provided.\n* **787 Program:** Boeing expects to gradually increase the 787 production rate to 5 per month in 2023.  The company is currently producing at \"low rates,\" but the exact starting rate is not specified.\n\n**Final Answer:** Boeing forecasts a gradual production rate increase for the 737 program in 2023, with no specific target rate. The 777X-9 production remains paused, while the 787 program is expected to reach 5 per month in 2023, up from current \"low rates.\"  No other specific production rate changes are mentioned for other aircraft programs.\n\n\n",
