1. Analyze document: AES 2022 10K, specifically the Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Income for fiscal years 2021 and 2022.

2. Detailed Analysis and Calculations:

* **Step 1: Locate FY2022 Net Income:** Find the net income for fiscal year 2022 from the statement of income.  Let's assume this value is represented by 'Net Income_2022'.

* **Step 2: Locate Total Assets for FY2021 and FY2022:** Obtain the total assets for both fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2022 from the statement of financial position. Let's represent these values as 'Total Assets_2021' and 'Total Assets_2022' respectively.

* **Step 3: Calculate Average Total Assets:** Compute the average total assets between FY2021 and FY2022 using the formula:  Average Total Assets = (Total Assets_2021 + Total Assets_2022) / 2

* **Step 4: Calculate Return on Assets (ROA):**  Divide the FY2022 net income by the average total assets calculated in Step 3.  ROA = Net Income_2022 / Average Total Assets.

* **Step 5: Round the Result:** Round the calculated ROA to two decimal places.


3. Response Rules:

*   Format the final ROA value to two decimal places.
*   If the calculated ROA is 0, state "nothing happened".
*   Present the final answer concisely as a single numerical value.  Do not include percentage signs or dollar signs.
*   Use a minus sign to indicate a negative value.


```

- **FY2022 Net Income:** $(505) million (AES_2022_10K.pdf, page 133)
- **FY2021 Total Assets:** $26599 million (AES_2022_10K.pdf, page 131)
- **FY2022 Total Assets:** $28073 million (AES_2022_10K.pdf, page 131)
- **Average Total Assets:** ($26599 million + $28073 million) / 2 = $27336 million
- **ROA:** $(505) million / $27336 million = -0.02

**Final Answer:** -0.02

## Correct Answer

-0.02
