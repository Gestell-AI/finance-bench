Focus on the sections detailing SG&A expenses, net sales, and any explanations for changes in SG&A as a percentage of net sales for FY2023.  Pay close attention to any discussions of cost-cutting measures, restructuring, changes in marketing strategies, or other factors that might explain the reduction.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n    * **Identify SG&A Expense:** Locate the SG&A expense figures for both FY2022 and FY2023.\n    * **Identify Net Sales:** Locate the net sales figures for both FY2022 and FY2023.\n    * **Calculate SG&A as a Percentage of Net Sales:** For both years, divide the SG&A expense by net sales and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n    * **Calculate the Change:** Determine the percentage point change in SG&A as a percentage of net sales between FY2022 and FY2023.  This is done by subtracting the FY2022 percentage from the FY2023 percentage.\n    * **Qualitative Analysis:**  Carefully examine the document for any explanations provided by the company regarding the reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. This might involve sections discussing operational efficiency improvements, cost-cutting initiatives, changes in marketing strategies, or other relevant factors.  Note any specific initiatives or events mentioned.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n    * Present the findings in a concise, bulleted list.\n    * Clearly state the calculated percentage change in SG&A as a percentage of net sales between FY2022 and FY2023, following the specified formatting rules (1 decimal place for percentages).\n    * Summarize the qualitative factors identified in the document that contributed to the reduction, using bullet points to list each factor.  If no specific reasons are given, state that no specific reasons were provided in the document.\n    * If the change is 0, state that \"no change occurred\".\n    * The response should not include any speculative or subjective interpretations beyond what is explicitly stated in the document.\n\n\n```\n\n* FY2022:\n    * Net Sales: $10.20 billions\n    * SG&A: $2.39 billions\n    * SG&A as a percentage of Net Sales: 23.5% ($2.39 billions / $10.20 billions * 100)\n* FY2023:\n    * Net Sales: $11.00 billions (Average of $10.95 and $11.05 billion)\n    * SG&A: $2.57 billions (Average of $10.95 billion * 14.7% and $11.05 billion * 15%)\n    * SG&A as a percentage of Net Sales: 23.4% ($2.57 billions / $11.00 billions * 100)\n\n* Change in SG&A as a percentage of Net Sales: -0.1% (23.4% - 23.5%)\n\n**Final Answer:** SG&A as a percent of net sales decreased by 0.1% driven by leverage of marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments and deleverage in corporate overhead due to strategic investments.\n\n\n",
