Focus on the sections reporting US sales growth and international sales growth for the fiscal year 2022 (FY2022).  Look for tables or figures explicitly presenting these figures, or textual descriptions providing the necessary data.\n\n2. **Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n* **Locate US Sales Growth:** Find the data representing the growth in US sales for FY2022. This might be presented as a percentage change, an absolute dollar change, or both.  Note the specific units (e.g., percentage, dollars).\n* **Locate International Sales Growth:** Similarly, locate the data for international sales growth in FY2022.  Again, note the units.\n* **Compare Growth Rates:** Once both growth rates are identified, compare them directly.  Determine which region (US or international) experienced higher growth.  If the data is presented in different units (e.g., one as a percentage and the other as a dollar amount), you may need to convert one to match the other for a meaningful comparison.  If both are percentages, simply compare the percentages. If both are dollar amounts, calculate the percentage change for each to allow for a direct comparison.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Present the comparison in a concise bullet point format.\n*   Clearly state which region (US or international) had higher sales growth in FY2022.\n*   Report the growth figures for both US and international sales using the specified formatting rules (percentage with 1 decimal place, dollar values with appropriate formatting for millions or billions).\n*   If the growth is 0 for either region, explicitly state \"nothing happened\" for that region.\n*   Conclude with a final answer summarizing the comparison.\n\n```\n\n*   2022 Full Year US sales grew by $1424 millions (3.0%)\n*   2022 Full Year International sales decrease by $256 millions (0.6%)\n\n**Final Answer:** J&J's US sales growth outperformed its international sales growth in FY2022, with a 3.0% increase compared to a decrease of 0.6%.\n\n\n",
