Specifically, we need to extract data on Accounts Payable for FY2019 and FY2020, Inventory for FY2019 and FY2020, and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2020.\n\n2. **Detailed Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n   * **Step 1: Identify Accounts Payable for FY2019 and FY2020:** Locate the values for Accounts Payable from the balance sheet for both fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Let's assume these values are:\n      * Accounts Payable FY2019: $X\n      * Accounts Payable FY2020: $Y\n\n   * **Step 2: Calculate Average Accounts Payable:**\n      * Average Accounts Payable = ($X + $Y) / 2\n\n   * **Step 3: Identify Inventory for FY2019 and FY2020:** Locate the values for Inventory from the balance sheet for both fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Let's assume these values are:\n      * Inventory FY2019: $A\n      * Inventory FY2020: $B\n\n   * **Step 4: Calculate Change in Inventory:**\n      * Change in Inventory = $B - $A\n\n   * **Step 5: Obtain COGS for FY2020:** Locate the value for Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) from the income statement for FY2020. Let's assume this value is:\n      * COGS FY2020: $C\n\n   * **Step 6: Calculate the Denominator:**\n      * Total Cost = $C + ($B - $A)\n\n   * **Step 7: Calculate Days Payable Outstanding (DPO):**\n      * DPO = (365 * Average Accounts Payable) / Total Cost\n      * DPO = (365 * (($X + $Y) / 2)) / ($C + ($B - $A))\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n   * Replace $X, $Y, $A, $B, and $C with the actual values from the CORNING 2020 10K financial statements.\n   * Perform the calculations as outlined above.\n   * Round the final DPO value to two decimal places.\n   * Present the final answer as a single number with two decimal places, following the specified formatting rules for numerical values in the Response Instructions.  If the calculation results in a value of 0, state \"Nothing happened\".  The response should not include any percentage change.\n\n```\n\n* **Accounts Payable:**\n    * FY2019: $1358 millions\n    * FY2020: $1269 millions\n* **Average Accounts Payable:** ($1358 + $1269) / 2 = $1313.50 millions\n* **Inventory:**\n    * FY2019: $2384 millions\n    * FY2020: $2583 millions\n* **Change in Inventory:** $2583 - $2384 = $199 millions\n* **FY2020 Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** $6758 millions\n* **Total Cost:** $6758 + $199 = $6957 millions\n* **Days Payable Outstanding (DPO):** (365 * $1313.50) / $6957 = 68.88\n\n**Final Answer:** 68.88\n\n\n",
