Correct document to analyze: Pfizer 2023Q2 10Q.  The relevant section is the financial statements (specifically the income statement or a revenue breakdown by geographic region) and any accompanying notes that provide details on revenue changes.\n\n2. Detailed Analysis and Calculations:\n\n* **Locate Revenue Data:** Find the revenue figures for each geographic region for both Q2 2023 and Q2 2022.  The 10-Q should clearly break down revenue by region (e.g., US, Developed Rest of World, Emerging Markets).\n\n* **Calculate Year-over-Year Revenue Change:** For each region, calculate the percentage change in revenue from Q2 2022 to Q2 2023 using the following formula:\n\n   `Percentage Change = [(Q2 2023 Revenue - Q2 2022 Revenue) / Q2 2022 Revenue] * 100`\n\n* **Identify the Largest Percentage Drop:** Compare the percentage change calculated for each region. The region with the most negative percentage change represents the biggest year-over-year drop in revenue.  If \"International\" is presented as a single category, treat it as \"Developed Rest of the World\".\n\n3. Response Rules:\n\n*   Present the answer as a concise bullet point.\n*   Clearly state the geographic region with the largest percentage decrease in revenue.\n*   Report the percentage change with one decimal place (e.g., -15.2%).\n*   If no region shows a decrease, state that \"No geographic region experienced a year-over-year revenue drop in Q2 2023.\"\n*   Follow all formatting rules specified in the `Response Instructions` section of the provided document.\n\n```\n\n* Developed Rest of World revenues decreased $3.7 billions, or 73.9%\n**Final Answer:** Developed Rest of World experienced the largest drop, with a 73.9% decrease.\n\n\n",
