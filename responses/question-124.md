1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the PepsiCo 2022 10K document. Specifically, focus on the Statement of Cash Flows and the Income Statement.

2. **Detailed Analysis and Calculations:**

* **Obtain Unadjusted Operating Income:** Locate "Operating Income" from the Income Statement.  This is our starting point for calculating unadjusted EBITDA. Let's assume this value is X.

* **Obtain Depreciation and Amortization:** Locate "Depreciation and Amortization" from the Statement of Cash Flows. Let's assume this value is Y.

* **Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA:** Add the values obtained in the previous two steps: Unadjusted EBITDA = X + Y.

* **Obtain Capital Expenditures (CAPEX):** Locate "Capital Expenditures" from the Statement of Cash Flows. Let's assume this value is Z.

* **Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA less CAPEX:** Subtract CAPEX from the Unadjusted EBITDA: Unadjusted EBITDA less CAPEX = (X + Y) - Z.

3. **Response Rules:**

* Format the final answer in USD millions with 2 decimal places.
* Present the final answer as a single numerical value representing the Unadjusted EBITDA less CAPEX in USD millions.  No percentage change is needed as the prompt only asks for the value.
* If the calculation results in a zero value, state "Nothing happened".
