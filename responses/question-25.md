1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the AMCOR 2023 10K document.  Specifically, focus on the sections detailing acquisitions or business combinations.  Look for sections such as "Business Combinations," "Acquisitions," or similar headings within the discussion of business activities and financial statements.  The MD&A (Management's Discussion and Analysis) section is also a likely place to find this information.

2. **Analysis and Calculations:**
    * **Identify Acquisition Descriptions:** Carefully read through the identified sections to locate descriptions of any acquisitions made by Amcor in FY2023, FY2022, and FY2021.  Pay close attention to the details provided for each acquisition, including the target company's name, the date of acquisition, and the purchase price or other relevant financial details.
    * **Record Acquisition Details:** Create a table to organize the information for each acquisition. The table should include columns for:
        * Fiscal Year
        * Target Company Name
        * Acquisition Date
        * Purchase Price (or other relevant financial details, if available)
    * **Handle Missing Information:** If the 10K does not provide a specific purchase price for an acquisition, note this in the table.  If the 10K only mentions an acquisition without providing details, note that as well.

3. **Response Rules:**
    * **Format:** Present the findings in a concise, bulleted list within a markdown table.
    * **Clarity:** Use clear and precise language.  Avoid ambiguity.
    * **Completeness:** Include all identified acquisitions with available details.  If no acquisitions occurred in a given year, state that explicitly.
    * **Conciseness:** Keep the response brief and to the point.  Only include information directly related to the acquisitions.
    * **Final Answer:** The final answer will be the table summarizing the acquisitions.  If no acquisitions are found, the final answer will state "No acquisitions were found in the specified fiscal years."
