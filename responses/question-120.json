The exact wording may vary slightly.\n*   Extract the numerical value for capital expenditures for the fiscal year 2021.  This value will be negative since it represents cash outflow.\n*   Convert the value from the statement of cash flows to billions of USD.  If the value is given in millions, divide by 1000.  If it is given in thousands, divide by 1,000,000.  Round to one decimal place.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Format the final answer as a positive number in billions of USD with one decimal place, preceded by a dollar sign ($).  For example: $2.5 billion.\n*   If the value is zero, respond with \"Nothing happened\".\n*   Do not include any additional commentary or analysis beyond the requested capital expenditure amount.\n\n```\n\n* Locate the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the PepsiCo 2021 10K.\n* Find the line item \"Capital spending\" under Investing Activities.\n* The value for 2021 is $(4,625) million.\n* Convert this to billions: $4,625 million / $1,000 million/billion = $4.6 billion.\n\n**Final Answer:** $4.6 billions\n\n\n",
