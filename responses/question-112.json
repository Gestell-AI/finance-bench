Analyze document: MICROSOFT 2023 10K. Specifically, examine the balance sheets for Fiscal Year 2023 (FY2023) and Fiscal Year 2022 (FY2022).  Locate the line item representing \"Total Debt\" or a similar comprehensive measure of debt (e.g., \"Long-term debt\" + \"Short-term debt\").\n\n2. Data Extraction and Calculation:\n\n* Extract the value of total debt from the FY2023 balance sheet.\n* Extract the value of total debt from the FY2022 balance sheet.\n* Calculate the change in debt:  FY2023 Total Debt - FY2022 Total Debt.\n* Calculate the percentage change: [(FY2023 Total Debt - FY2022 Total Debt) / FY2022 Total Debt] * 100.\n\n3. Response Generation Rules:\n\n* Format dollar values according to the provided guidelines (millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero).\n* Format percentage changes with 1 decimal place.\n* If the change in debt is zero, state \"Microsoft's debt on the balance sheet remained unchanged between FY2023 and FY2022.\"\n* If the change is positive, state \"Microsoft increased its debt on the balance sheet by $X between FY2023 and FY2022, representing a Y% increase.\"  Replace X with the calculated dollar change and Y with the calculated percentage change.\n* If the change is negative, state \"Microsoft decreased its debt on the balance sheet by $X between FY2023 and FY2022, representing a Y% decrease.\" Replace X with the calculated dollar change (formatted as a decrease) and Y with the calculated percentage change.\n\n\n```\n\n* **FY2023 Total Debt:** $41.99 billions\n* **FY2022 Total Debt:** $47.03 billions\n* **Change in Debt:** $41.99 billions - $47.03 billions = decrease in $5.04 billions\n* **Percentage Change:** (decrease in $5.04 billions / $47.03 billions) * 100 = -10.7%\n\n**Final Answer:** Microsoft decreased its debt on the balance sheet by $5.04 billions between FY2023 and FY2022, representing a 10.7% decrease.\n\n\n",
