Let's assume this value is X.\n   * **Step 2: Subtract Inventories:** Find the \"Inventories\" value on the same balance sheet. Let's assume this value is Y. Calculate Quick Assets: Quick Assets = X - Y.\n   * **Step 3: Identify Current Liabilities:** Locate \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet. Let's assume this value is Z.\n   * **Step 4: Calculate the Quick Ratio:**  Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = (X - Y) / Z.\n   * **Step 5: Interpret the Quick Ratio:** If the calculated Quick Ratio is below 1.0, conclude that 3M does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on this metric. If it is 1.0 or above, conclude that 3M has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on this metric.  Format the Quick Ratio to two decimal places as instructed.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n   * Use bullet points to present the analysis steps.\n   * Clearly state the values of X, Y, and Z obtained from the 10-Q.\n   * Show the calculation of the Quick Ratio.\n   * State the final conclusion regarding 3M's liquidity profile based on the calculated Quick Ratio, following the formatting guidelines (two decimal places for the Quick Ratio).\n   * If the necessary data is missing from the 10-Q, state that the calculation cannot be performed and explain why (e.g., missing data points).\n\n\n```\n\n*   Total Current Assets (June 30, 2023): $15754 million (X)\n*   Total Inventories (June 30, 2023): $5280 million (Y)\n*   Total Current Liabilities (June 30, 2023): $10936 million (Z)\n*   Quick Assets = X - Y = $15754 million - $5280 million = $10474 million\n*   Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = $10474 million / $10936 million = 0.96\n\n**Final Answer:** 3M's quick ratio for Q2 2023 is 0.96.  Since this is below 1.0, 3M does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on this metric.\n\n\n",
  "answer": "No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark",
