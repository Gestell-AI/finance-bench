1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the "BOEING 2022 10K" document.  Specifically, focus on the sections detailing Boeing's customers and sales breakdowns.  Look for sections such as the "Business Overview," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and the notes to the financial statements.  These sections often provide details on the major customers and their contribution to revenue.

2. **Analysis:**
    * **Identify Customer Segments:** The 10-K should categorize customers into segments (e.g., commercial airlines, government agencies, etc.).  Note the specific names of major customers if mentioned.
    * **Revenue Breakdown:** Look for tables or charts showing revenue breakdown by customer segment or individual customer (if disclosed).  This will indicate the relative importance of each customer group.
    * **Qualitative Information:**  Read the narrative descriptions of the business to understand the relationships with key customers and any significant changes in customer base from previous years.

3. **Response Rules:**
    * Use bullet points to list the primary customer segments.
    * If specific customer names are disclosed and material, include them.
    * Quantify the importance of each customer segment using revenue percentages or other relevant metrics if available in the 10-K.
    * If the 10-K does not provide specific customer names, state that the primary customers are categorized into specific segments (e.g., "The primary customers of Boeing are primarily commercial airlines and government agencies").
    * If no information on primary customers is found, state that the document does not provide information on primary customers.
    * Follow the formatting rules specified in the "Response Instructions" section.


```

- Boeing's 2022 10K does not explicitly name its primary customers.
- Instead, it categorizes its customer base into segments for its three main business units:
  - **Commercial Airplanes (BCA):** Customers are primarily commercial airlines worldwide. The 10K provides a geographic breakdown of BCA revenues, with the United States accounting for $12167 million, Asia for $4484 million, Europe for $4038 million, the Middle East for $2003 million, and other non-U.S. locations for $3042 million.
  - **Defense, Space & Security (BDS):** The primary customer is the U.S. government, including foreign military sales, which generated 89% of BDS revenue in 2022. Non-U.S. government customers accounted for the remaining revenue.
  - **Global Services (BGS):** This segment serves a diverse customer base, including commercial airlines, government agencies, and other organizations. The 10K does not provide a detailed customer breakdown for BGS.

**Final Answer:** The primary customers of Boeing are categorized into commercial airlines (BCA), the U.S. government (BDS), and a diverse customer base including commercial airlines, government agencies, and other organizations (BGS).

## Correct Answer

Boeing's primary customers as of FY2022 are a limited number of commercial airlines and the US government. The US government accounted for 40% of Boeing's total revenues in FY2022.
