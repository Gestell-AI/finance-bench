Specifically, locate the financial statements (income statement or a summary of financial results) for fiscal year (FY) 2023.  Look for a line item explicitly labeled \"Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA\" or a similar description within the FY 2023 results.  If not explicitly stated, look for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures that allows for the calculation of Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA.\n\n2. **Analysis and Calculation:**\n\n*   **Locate Relevant Data:** Find the values for Net Income, Taxes, Interest Expense, and Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) for FY 2023.  These values should be clearly identified as belonging to the fiscal year and not just the Q4 results.  If using the \"Using Net Income\" method from the instructions, sum these values according to the formula:  `EBITDA = Net Income + Taxes + Interest Expense + D&A`. If using the \"Using Operating Income\" method, find the Operating Income and D&A values for FY 2023 and use the formula: `EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A`.  The document should clearly state whether the EBITDA figure is adjusted or not. If not, and a reconciliation is provided, use the reconciliation to calculate the adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA.\n\n*   **Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA:**  The document may present an \"Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA\" figure directly. If so, use this value. If not, use the calculation from the previous step to determine the EBITDA.  Then, carefully review any notes or reconciliations provided to adjust the EBITDA figure to a non-GAAP basis.  This might involve adding back or subtracting specific items (e.g., restructuring charges, one-time gains/losses) as described in the document's notes.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Report the final answer as a dollar value, formatted according to the specified rules (millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero).  If the value is zero, state \"nothing happened\".  No percentage change is needed as there is no prior period for comparison.\n*   The response should be a concise bullet point outlining the final answer.  For example:\n    * AMCOR's Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA for FY 2023: $XXX.XX millions\n    * If the value is zero: Nothing happened.\n\n\n```\n\n* AMCOR's Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA for FY 2023: $2018.00 millions\n\n\n",
