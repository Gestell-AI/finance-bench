Specifically, focus on the income statement for fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\n2. **Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n* **Step 1: Locate Operating Income:** For each fiscal year (FY2019, FY2020, FY2021), find the value of \"Operating Income\" from the income statement.  Let's denote these values as OI_2019, OI_2020, and OI_2021 respectively.\n\n* **Step 2: Locate Net Sales:** For each fiscal year (FY2019, FY2020, FY2021), find the value of \"Net Sales\" (or a similar line item representing total revenue) from the income statement. Let's denote these values as NS_2019, NS_2020, and NS_2021 respectively.\n\n* **Step 3: Calculate Operating Income Margin for Each Year:** For each year, calculate the operating income margin using the formula:\n\n   Operating Income Margin = (Operating Income / Net Sales) * 100\n\n   Calculate this for each year: OIM_2019, OIM_2020, OIM_2021.\n\n* **Step 4: Calculate the 3-Year Average:** Add the three annual operating income margins (OIM_2019, OIM_2020, OIM_2021) and divide by 3:\n\n   3-Year Average Operating Income Margin = (OIM_2019 + OIM_2020 + OIM_2021) / 3\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Format the final 3-year average operating income margin as a percentage with one decimal place (e.g., 12.3%).\n*   The response should be concise and clearly state the calculated 3-year average.  No additional commentary is needed beyond the final answer.\n*   If any of the required data is missing from the 10K, clearly state that the calculation cannot be performed due to missing data.\n\n\n```\n\n* **FY2019 Operating Income:** $1306 million\n* **FY2019 Net Sales:** $11503 million\n* **FY2019 Operating Margin:** ($1306/$11503) * 100 = 11.3%\n\n* **FY2020 Operating Income:** $509 million\n* **FY2020 Net Sales:** $11303 million\n* **FY2020 Operating Margin:** ($509/$11303) * 100 = 4.5%\n\n* **FY2021 Operating Income:** $2112 million\n* **FY2021 Net Sales:** $14082 million\n* **FY2021 Operating Margin:** ($2112/$14082) * 100 = 15.0%\n\n* **3-Year Average Operating Margin:** (11.3% + 4.5% + 15.0%) / 3 = 10.3%\n\n**Final Answer:** 10.3%\n\n\n",
