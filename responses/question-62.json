Focus on the sections detailing legal proceedings, litigation, or risk factors.  This information is typically found in the \"Legal Proceedings\" or \"Risk Factors\" sections of the 10-K filing.\n\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n    * **Identify Legal Proceedings:** Carefully review the designated sections to identify any ongoing legal battles.  Pay close attention to descriptions of the nature of the litigation, the parties involved, and the potential financial impact.\n    * **Assess Materiality:**  Determine whether the identified legal battles are \"materially important.\"  A legal battle is materially important if it has a significant potential impact on Boeing's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Consider the potential financial penalties, reputational damage, or impact on future business operations.  Use your judgment based on the information provided in the 10-K.  Look for quantifiable estimates of potential losses or qualitative descriptions of significant risks.\n    * **Summarize Findings:** Concisely summarize the materially important ongoing legal battles, including a brief description of each case and its potential impact.\n\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n    * Respond in a concise, bulleted list format.\n    * If no materially important ongoing legal battles are identified, state: \"Boeing did not report any materially important ongoing legal battles from FY2022.\"\n    * If materially important ongoing legal battles are identified, list them with a brief description of each and its potential impact.  Do not include irrelevant details.  Follow the formatting guidelines provided in the \"Response Instructions\" section.\n\n```\n\n*   **Multiple lawsuits related to the 737 MAX accidents:** Boeing faces numerous lawsuits stemming from the two fatal crashes involving the 737 MAX aircraft. While some settlements have been reached (e.g., Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, shareholder derivative lawsuit settlement, settlement with the SEC), other lawsuits remain pending.  Boeing states that it \"cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss\" for these remaining lawsuits.  This indicates a material risk, as the potential financial impact is unknown and could be significant.\n\n*   **Arbitration with Embraer:** Boeing terminated agreements with Embraer related to joint ventures in commercial aircraft and services. Embraer disputes the termination, and the matter is in arbitration.  Boeing states that it \"cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss\" from this arbitration.  Similar to the 737 MAX litigation, the unknown potential financial impact represents a material risk.\n\n**Final Answer:** Boeing reported two materially important ongoing legal battles from FY2022: multiple lawsuits related to the 737 MAX accidents, and arbitration with Embraer.  Both carry an uncertain but potentially significant financial impact.\n\n\n",
  "answer": "Yes. Multiple lawsuits have been filed against Boeing resulting from a 2018 Lion Air crash and a 2019 Ethiopian Airlines crash.",
