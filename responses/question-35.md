1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the AMD 2022 10K document. Focus on the sections discussing operating margin and any factors influencing its change in FY22.  Look for discussions of revenue, cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and any significant events impacting profitability.  The Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section will likely contain the most relevant information.

2. **Analysis:**

*   **Locate Operating Margin Data:** Find the operating margin for FY22 and FY21. Calculate the percentage change in operating margin from FY21 to FY22.
*   **Identify Revenue Changes:** Determine the percentage change in revenue from FY21 to FY22.  Analyze if revenue growth contributed positively or negatively to the operating margin change.
*   **Analyze Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Determine the percentage change in COGS from FY21 to FY22.  Analyze if changes in COGS (e.g., due to increased component costs, manufacturing efficiencies, or changes in product mix) impacted the operating margin.
*   **Analyze Operating Expenses:** Determine the percentage change in operating expenses from FY21 to FY22.  Analyze if changes in operating expenses (e.g., R&D, SG&A) impacted the operating margin.
*   **Identify One-Time Events:** Check for any one-time events (acquisitions, legal settlements, restructuring charges, etc.) that significantly impacted FY22's operating margin.  List these events with their financial impact.
*   **Assess the Usefulness of Operating Margin:** Based on the analysis, determine if operating margin is a useful metric for assessing AMD's performance. Consider factors like the company's industry (semiconductors), business model, and the presence of significant one-time events. If operating margin is not a useful metric, explain why.  For example, high R&D spending in a technology company might temporarily depress operating margin, but it could be a necessary investment for future growth.

3. **Response Rules:**

*   Follow the specified formatting rules for dollar values, percentages, and ratios.
*   Present the analysis in a concise, bulleted list.
*   State the percentage change in operating margin from FY21 to FY22.
*   If operating margin is deemed not useful, explain why and suggest alternative metrics if appropriate (e.g., gross margin, EBITDA).
*   If the operating margin change is zero, state "Nothing happened".
*   Conclude with a final answer summarizing the key drivers of the operating margin change.

```

- Operating income decreased from $3.65 billions in FY21 to $1.26 billions in FY22.
- Revenue increased from $16.43 billions in FY21 to $23.60 billions in FY22, a 43.6% increase.
- Cost of sales, including amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, increased from $8.51 billions in FY21 to $12.99 billions in FY22, a 52.7% increase.
- Research and development expenses increased from $2.85 billions in FY22 to $5.01 billions in FY23, a 75.8% increase.
- Marketing, general, and administrative expenses increased from $1.45 billions in FY21 to $2.34 billions in FY22, a 61.4% increase.
- Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $3.55 billions in FY22 significantly impacted operating expenses, primarily due to the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions.

**Final Answer:** Operating margin decreased by 65.4% from FY21 to FY22. The decrease was primarily driven by increased operating expenses, including significant amortization charges related to acquisitions, despite a substantial increase in revenue. While operating margin is generally a useful metric, in this specific case, the significant impact of one-time acquisition-related expenses makes it less informative for evaluating AMD's core operating performance in FY22. Analyzing gross margin or EBITDA might offer additional insights.

## Correct Answer

The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition
