Analyze document: AMD 2022 10K.  Specifically, extract the values for Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Accounts receivable, net, Receivables from related parties, and Current liabilities from the balance sheet for FY22.\n\n2. Detailed analysis and calculations:\n\n* **Step 1: Calculate Quick Assets:** Sum the values of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Accounts receivable, net, and Receivables from related parties.  This will give you the total \"Quick Assets\".\n\n* **Step 2: Identify Current Liabilities:** Obtain the value of Current liabilities from the balance sheet.\n\n* **Step 3: Calculate the Quick Ratio:** Divide the \"Quick Assets\" (calculated in Step 1) by the \"Current Liabilities\" (obtained in Step 2).  This will give you the Quick Ratio.\n\n* **Step 4: Assess Liquidity:**  A quick ratio below 1.0 is generally considered unhealthy.  Assess whether the calculated quick ratio is above or below 1.0.  If below 1.0, state that AMD does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on this metric. If above 1.0, state that AMD does have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on this metric.  If the quick ratio is significantly above 1.0, consider mentioning that this indicates a strong liquidity position.  If it is only slightly above 1.0, consider mentioning that while technically healthy, it may be prudent to monitor the ratio closely.\n\n* **Step 5: Relevance of Quick Ratio:**  Address the prompt's question about the relevance of the quick ratio.  While the provided formula is a variation of the standard quick ratio (excluding inventories), it still assesses the ability to meet short-term obligations with liquid assets.  Argue that it is still a relevant measure of liquidity, even if it differs slightly from the traditional formula.  However, acknowledge that other liquidity ratios (such as the current ratio) could provide a more comprehensive picture.\n\n3. Response rules:\n\n* Use the specified formatting rules for dollar values, percentages, and ratios.\n* Present the analysis in a concise, bulleted list.\n* State the calculated quick ratio with two decimal places.\n* Clearly state whether AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on the calculated quick ratio, justifying the answer with the ratio's value and its interpretation.\n* Explicitly address the relevance of the quick ratio to liquidity assessment, acknowledging both its usefulness and potential limitations.\n* Conclude with a final answer that summarizes the liquidity assessment.\n\n```\n\nThe user wants to know if AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22.\nI need to calculate the quick ratio using the provided formula and then assess if the ratio indicates a healthy liquidity profile.\nIf the quick ratio is not relevant, I need to explain why.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Find the values for Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Accounts receivable, net, Receivables from related parties, and Current liabilities for FY22 from the AMD 2022 10K document.\n2. Calculate the quick ratio using the formula: (Cash and cash equivalents + Short-term investments + Accounts receivable, net + Receivables from related parties) / Current liabilities.\n3. Assess if the calculated quick ratio indicates a healthy liquidity profile. A quick ratio of 1 or higher is generally considered healthy.\n4. If the quick ratio is not relevant, explain why. billions.\n*   Identified current liabilities as $4.2 billions.\n*   Calculated quick assets: $4.6 billions + $1.3 billions + $3.1 billions + $0.0 billions = $9.0 billions.\n*   Calculated the quick ratio: $9.0 billions / $4.2 billions = 2.14.\n*   A quick ratio of 2.14 is above 1.0, indicating that AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on this metric.\n*   The quick ratio is relevant for measuring liquidity as it assesses a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nYes, AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio of 2.14 for FY22.\n\n\n",
  "answer": "Yes. The quick ratio is 1.57, calculated as (cash and cash equivalents+Short term investments+Accounts receivable, net+receivables from related parties)/ (current liabilities).",
