1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the JOHNSON JOHNSON 2023 8K dated-2023-08-30 document. Focus on sections discussing the Kenvue spin-off or separation.  Look for explicit statements regarding the treatment of Kenvue as a discontinued operation from August 30, 2023.

2. **Analysis:**
   * Carefully read the sections detailing the Kenvue spin-off.
   * Identify any statements explicitly classifying Kenvue as a discontinued operation post-August 30, 2023.  Look for phrases like "discontinued operations," "disposal of a business segment," or similar terminology.
   * Note the specific wording used to describe the accounting treatment of Kenvue after the spin-off.

3. **Response Rules:**
   * Respond with a concise bullet point list.
   * If the document explicitly states Kenvue is treated as a discontinued operation, state this clearly.
   * If the document does not explicitly state this, state that the document does not provide sufficient information to determine whether Kenvue is treated as a discontinued operation.  Do not speculate.
   * Adhere to the specified formatting rules for numbers and currency.

```

- The provided text details the separation of Kenvue from Johnson & Johnson, including financial impacts.
- The 8-K explicitly states Kenvue's financials were included in Johnson & Johnson's results _before_ the separation.
- The document then provides updated guidance _excluding_ the Consumer Health segment (Kenvue).
- This strongly implies Kenvue is treated as a discontinued operation, as its results are no longer consolidated.

Final Answer: Kenvue is treated as a discontinued operation from August 30, 2023, onward.

## Correct Answer

The Consumer Health business segment will be treated as a discontinued operation from August 30, 2023 onward.
