Correct document and section to analyze: JOHNSON JOHNSON 2022Q4 EARNINGS document; focus on the sections discussing FY2023 adjusted EPS guidance or projections.  Look for management commentary and any explicit statements regarding EPS growth acceleration.\n\n2. Detailed analysis and calculations:\n\n*   Locate the company's FY2023 adjusted EPS guidance within the 2022Q4 earnings report.  This will likely be in the press release or earnings call transcript.\n*   Identify the projected adjusted EPS for FY2023.\n*   Locate the reported adjusted EPS for FY2022 (or the most recent full fiscal year prior to FY2023).  This may require looking at previous earnings reports or the annual report.\n*   Calculate the percentage change in adjusted EPS from FY2022 to FY2023 using the formula: [(FY2023 adjusted EPS - FY2022 adjusted EPS) / FY2022 adjusted EPS] * 100%.\n*   Analyze management's commentary on the FY2023 EPS guidance. Look for statements explicitly mentioning whether they expect growth to accelerate compared to previous years.  Consider factors they cite, such as expected sales growth, cost-cutting measures, or changes in the business environment.\n*   Assess both sides of the argument:  Even if the percentage change in EPS is positive, determine if management explicitly states that this represents an *acceleration* in growth compared to prior years.  If the growth rate is lower than previous years, then growth is not accelerating, even if it is still positive.\n\n3. Rules for responding:\n\n*   Present the findings in a concise, bullet-point format.\n*   Clearly state the FY2022 and FY2023 adjusted EPS figures.\n*   Show the calculation of the percentage change in adjusted EPS.\n*   Summarize management's commentary regarding EPS growth expectations for FY2023, specifically addressing whether they anticipate acceleration.\n*   Provide a final answer stating whether growth in J&J's adjusted EPS is expected to accelerate in FY2023, based on the numerical data and management's statements.  The response should explicitly state if there is no acceleration or if there is acceleration.  If there is no explicit statement, state that there is no clear indication of acceleration.\n*   Follow the specified formatting rules for numbers and currency.\n\n\n```\n\n*   FY2022 Adjusted EPS: $10.15\n*   FY2023 Adjusted EPS Guidance: $10.50\n*   Dollar Change: $10.50 - $10.15 = $0.35\n*   Percentage Change: ($0.35 / $10.15) * 100% = 3.4%\n*   Management projects adjusted operational sales growth excluding COVID-19 Vaccine of 4.0% and adjusted operational EPS of $10.50, reflecting growth of 3.5%. While this represents growth, management does not explicitly state this is an *acceleration* of growth.\n\n**Final Answer:** J&J's adjusted EPS is projected to grow by $0.35 or 3.4% in FY2023, but there is no clear indication from management's commentary that this represents an acceleration of growth.\n\n\n",
  "answer": "No, rate of growth in adjusted EPS is expected to decelerate slightly from 3.6% in FY2022 to 3.5% in FY2023.",
