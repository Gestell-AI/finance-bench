1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the "JOHNSON JOHNSON 2022 10K" document.  Specifically, focus on the Income Statement to find the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and the Balance Sheets for the fiscal years 2021 and 2022 to find the beginning and ending inventory levels.

2. **Detailed Analysis and Calculations:**

   * **Step 1: Locate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Find the COGS for fiscal year 2022 from the income statement.  Let's assume (this value needs to be extracted from the 10K) the COGS for FY2022 is $50.00 billions.

   * **Step 2: Determine Beginning and Ending Inventory Levels:**
      * **Beginning Inventory:** Find the "Ending Inventory" value from the balance sheet for fiscal year 2021. Let's assume (this value needs to be extracted from the 10K) this is $8.00 billions.
      * **Ending Inventory:** Find the "Ending Inventory" value from the balance sheet for fiscal year 2022. Let's assume (this value needs to be extracted from the 10K) this is $9.00 billions.

   * **Step 3: Calculate the Average Inventory:**
      * Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2
      * Average Inventory = ($8.00 billions + $9.00 billions) / 2 = $8.50 billions

   * **Step 4: Compute the Inventory Turnover Ratio:**
      * Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory
      * Inventory Turnover Ratio = $50.00 billions / $8.50 billions = 5.88

   * **Step 5: Interpret the Inventory Turnover Ratio:**  An inventory turnover ratio of 5.88 indicates that Johnson & Johnson sold its inventory roughly 5.88 times during fiscal year 2022.  Whether this is considered efficient depends on industry benchmarks and Johnson & Johnson's specific business model.  If the company's inventory management is not meaningful in the conventional sense (e.g., due to specialized or long-term inventory), this should be stated and explained.  This requires further analysis of the 10K to understand the nature of J&J's inventory.

3. **Response Rules:**

   * Respond in cleanly formatted Markdown using bullet points.
   * The final answer should state the inventory turnover ratio with two decimal places (5.88).
   * If conventional inventory management is not meaningful for J&J, explain why based on information found in the 10K.  This explanation should be included as a bullet point.
   * The response should end with a final answer summarizing the inventory turnover ratio.  No percentage change is needed as this is a ratio, not a change over time.

**Example Response (using placeholder values; replace with actual values from the 10K):**

* COGS for FY2022: $50.00 billions
* Beginning Inventory (FY2021): $8.00 billions
* Ending Inventory (FY2022): $9.00 billions
* Average Inventory: $8.50 billions
* Inventory Turnover Ratio: 5.88

**Final Answer:** Johnson & Johnson sold its inventory approximately 5.88 times in FY2022.  (Further analysis of the 10K is needed to determine if conventional inventory management is meaningful for the company and to provide a more detailed explanation if not.)

```

- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) in FY2022: $31.1 billions (pg 34-35)
- Beginning Inventory (FY2021): $10.387 billions (pg 58)
- Ending Inventory (FY2022): $12.483 billions (pg 58)
- Average Inventory: ($10.387 billions + $12.483 billions) / 2 = $11.435 billions
- Inventory Turnover Ratio: $31.1 billions / $11.435 billions = 2.72

**Final Answer:** Johnson & Johnson sold its inventory approximately 2.72 times in FY2022.

## Correct Answer

JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022.
