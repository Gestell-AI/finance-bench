Focus on the discussion and analysis of financial performance, looking for explanations of revenue growth or decline.  Pay close attention to any segment breakdowns (e.g., Computing and Graphics, Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom) and explanations provided for changes in each segment.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n    * **Identify Revenue Change:** Determine the total revenue for FY22 and compare it to the total revenue for FY21. Calculate the absolute dollar change and the percentage change.\n    * **Segment Analysis:** Examine the revenue contribution of each segment (Computing and Graphics, Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom) for both FY22 and FY21. Calculate the dollar and percentage change for each segment.\n    * **Identify Key Drivers:** Based on the 10K's discussion and analysis, identify the factors contributing to the revenue change in each segment and overall.  This might include market share gains, new product launches, increased demand, pricing changes, or macroeconomic factors.  Look for specific statements explaining the performance of each segment.\n    * **Quantify Drivers (if possible):** If the 10K provides quantitative data on the impact of specific drivers (e.g., \"New product X contributed $Y million to revenue growth\"), include this information.\n    * **One-time events:** Identify any one-time events (acquisitions, legal rulings, etc.) that impacted revenue and quantify their effect if possible.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n    * Present the analysis in a concise, bulleted list.\n    * Begin with the overall revenue change (dollar and percentage).\n    * Break down the revenue change by segment, showing dollar and percentage changes for each.\n    * Clearly state the key drivers of revenue change for each segment and overall, citing specific information from the 10K.\n    * Quantify the impact of drivers whenever possible.\n    * If no significant change occurred, state \"Nothing happened\".\n    * Format numbers according to the provided instructions (dollar values, percentages, etc.).\n    * Conclude with a final answer summarizing the key drivers of revenue change for FY22.\n\n\n```\n\n* Overall revenue increased by $7167.00 millions (44.0%)\n* Data Center: Revenue increased by $2325.00 millions (64.0%), driven by higher sales of EPYC™ server processors.\n* Client: Revenue decreased by $682.00 millions (10.0%), primarily due to lower processor shipments driven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain.  Partially offsetting the decrease in unit shipments was a 19% increase in average selling price driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales.\n* Gaming: Revenue increased by $1151.00 millions (21.0%), driven by higher semi-custom product sales due to higher demand for gaming console SoCs, partially offset by lower gaming graphics sales due to soft consumer demand.\n* Embedded: Revenue increased by $4354.00 millions, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product revenue following the acquisition of Xilinx in February 2022.\n\n**Final Answer:** AMD's FY22 revenue growth was primarily driven by substantial increases in the Data Center and Embedded segments, due to strong demand for EPYC™ server processors and the acquisition of Xilinx, respectively.  This growth was partially offset by a decline in the Client segment due to a weak PC market. The Gaming segment also experienced growth, driven by semi-custom product sales.\n\n\n",
