Focus on the sections discussing significant events, business segments, and any disclosures related to spin-offs, separations, or divestitures.  Pay close attention to the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section and the notes to the financial statements.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n    * **Scan for Keywords:** Search for keywords such as \"spin-off,\" \"separation,\" \"divestiture,\" \"disposal,\" \"sale,\" or similar terms within the identified sections.\n    * **Review Business Segment Information:** Examine the descriptions of Pfizer's business segments. Look for any indications that a segment is being prepared for a spin-off or has been spun off during the quarter.\n    * **Examine Financial Statement Notes:** Check the notes to the financial statements for any details on significant transactions, including potential spin-offs.  Look for any changes in the composition of business segments or unusual accounting treatments that might indicate a spin-off.\n    * **Identify Any Disclosures:** If any spin-offs are mentioned, carefully note the details provided, including the size of the business segment involved (in terms of revenue, assets, or other relevant metrics).\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n    * If the document indicates Pfizer spun off a large business segment in Q2 2023, list the segment and provide details about its size (e.g., revenue, assets) if available.  Format the response according to the provided guidelines (dollar values, percentages, etc.).\n    * If the document does not mention any large business segment spin-offs, respond with: \"Nothing happened\".\n    * If the document mentions a spin-off but lacks sufficient detail to determine if it was \"large,\" state that a spin-off occurred but the size cannot be determined.\n    * Use bullet points to present the information clearly and concisely.  The final answer should include both the $ and % changes if applicable, following the specified formatting rules.\n\n```\n\n* Pfizer's 2023 Q2 10Q mentions the establishment of a new operating segment, \"Business Innovation,\" in Q1 2023. This segment includes Pfizer CentreOne (PC1) and Pfizer Ignite.\n* The 10Q does not characterize this as a spin-off, but rather an internal reorganization.  \n* The document does not discuss any spin-offs of large business segments in Q2 2023.\n\n**Final Answer:** Nothing happened\n\n\n",
