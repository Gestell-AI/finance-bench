1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the "ULTABEAUTY 2023 10K" document.  Specifically, examine the sections detailing debt securities and their registration status.  Look for sections describing the company's debt, bond issuances, or similar financial instruments.  The relevant information will likely be found within the financial statements (balance sheet, notes to the financial statements) or the management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) section.

2. **Analysis:**
   * Carefully review the sections identified in step 1.
   * Search for explicit mentions of debt securities issued by Ulta Beauty.
   * Identify any statements indicating whether these securities are registered for trading on a national securities exchange.  Look for phrases like "listed on," "registered with," or similar terms that explicitly state the exchange(s) where the securities trade.
   * If the document lists multiple debt securities, note each one and its trading status separately.
   * If the document does not explicitly state whether the securities are registered for trading on a national exchange, state that the information is not available.
