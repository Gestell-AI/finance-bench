Specifically, examine the sections describing PepsiCo's business segments and geographic operations.  This information is typically found in the business overview, management discussion and analysis (MD&A), or the segment reporting sections of the 10-K filing.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n   * Carefully read the sections identified above to identify the geographic regions where PepsiCo operates.  Look for explicit mentions of countries or regions, and any breakdowns of revenue or operating results by geographic area.  The 10-K will likely categorize these regions into segments (e.g., North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, etc.).  Note the specific names used by PepsiCo for its geographic segments.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n   * Respond using bullet points, clearly listing each primary geographic region where PepsiCo operates as of FY2022.\n   * Use the exact names of the geographic segments as they appear in the 10-K.\n   * Do not add any additional interpretation or commentary beyond listing the regions.\n   * If the 10-K does not provide a clear breakdown of primary operating geographies, state that the information is not readily available in the provided document.\n\n\n```\n\n*   FLNA (Frito-Lay North America)\n*   QFNA (Quaker Foods North America)\n*   PBNA (PepsiCo Beverages North America)\n*   LatAm (Latin America)\n*   Europe\n*   AMESA (Africa, Middle East and South Asia)\n*   APAC (Asia Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and China)\n\n**Final Answer:** PepsiCo primarily operates in FLNA, QFNA, PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA, and APAC as of FY2022.\n\n\n",
