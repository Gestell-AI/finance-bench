1. Correct document and section to analyze: AMERICANEXPRESS 2022 10K.  The specific section to analyze is the section detailing American Express' debt securities and their registration status. This will likely be found within the financial statements or notes to the financial statements.  A thorough review of the entire document may be necessary to ensure all relevant information is captured.

2. Detailed analysis:

*   Locate the section of the 10-K that describes American Express' debt securities. This section will likely list the different types of debt securities issued by the company.
*   Carefully examine the description of each debt security to identify whether it is registered to trade on a national securities exchange under American Express' name.  Look for keywords such as "registered," "listed," "exchange," and the name of specific exchanges (e.g., NYSE, NASDAQ).
*   If a debt security is registered for trading on a national exchange, note its name and any other relevant details provided in the 10-K (e.g., amount outstanding, maturity date).
*   If multiple debt securities meet the criteria, list them all.
*   If no debt securities are registered to trade on a national securities exchange under American Express' name, explicitly state this.

3. Response rules:

*   Respond in a concise, bulleted list.
*   For each debt security that meets the criteria, provide its name.
*   If no debt securities meet the criteria, state "No debt securities are registered to trade on a national securities exchange under American Express' name as of 2022."
*   Follow all formatting guidelines specified in the `Response Instructions` section of the provided document.

The user is asking to identify debt securities of American Express that are registered to trade on a national securities exchange, based on the provided 2022 10K filing. I need to carefully read through the document, specifically looking for mentions of debt securities and their registration status on exchanges.

After reviewing the provided documents, I found information about American Express' common shares being registered on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) but no explicit mention of their debt securities being registered for trading on a national securities exchange.

There are none
