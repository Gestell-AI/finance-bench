Analyze the AMERICANWATERWORKS 2022 10K document, specifically the balance sheet for FY2022.  Locate the values for \"Total Current Assets\" and \"Total Current Liabilities\".\n\n2. **Calculate Working Capital:**\n   * Obtain the value of \"Total Current Assets\" from the balance sheet.\n   * Obtain the value of \"Total Current Liabilities\" from the balance sheet.\n   * Calculate Working Capital using the formula: Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current Liabilities.\n\n3. **Assess the Usefulness of Working Capital:**\n   * Evaluate whether a positive working capital is indicative of financial health for a utility company like American Water Works. Consider whether the nature of their business (providing essential services with relatively stable cash flows) makes working capital a less critical indicator compared to other metrics like cash flow from operations or debt levels.  Consider both arguments for and against the usefulness of working capital for this specific company.\n\n4. **Formulate the Response:**\n   * If working capital is positive, state the calculated value and whether it is considered healthy for the company, considering the points raised in step 3.\n   * If working capital is negative, state the calculated value and discuss the implications, again considering the context of the company's business model.\n   * If working capital is deemed not useful or relevant, clearly state this and provide a detailed explanation justifying why other metrics are more appropriate for assessing the financial health of American Water Works.  This explanation should include the reasons why working capital is not a useful metric in this context.  The explanation should be detailed and comprehensive.\n\n5. **Formatting:**\n   * Format the working capital value according to the provided guidelines (dollar values with appropriate formatting).\n   * Present the analysis and conclusion in a clear, concise, and well-structured markdown format using bullet points.\n   * The final answer should state whether American Water Works has positive working capital based on FY2022 data and include a justification for the assessment of the usefulness of working capital as a metric for this company.\n\n```\n\nThe user wants to know if American Water Works has positive working capital in 2022 based on the provided 10K document. If not, or if working capital isn't a useful metric, I need to explain why.\n\nPlan:\n1. Find the 2022 balance sheet in the AMERICANWATERWORKS_2022_10K.pdf document.\n2. Extract the values for Total Current Assets and Total Current Liabilities.\n3. Calculate Working Capital (Current Assets - Current Liabilities).\n4. Determine if the result is positive.\n5. Evaluate the usefulness of working capital for a utility company like American Water Works and provide a justification.   Identified the Consolidated Balance Sheets within the AMERICANWATERWORKS_2022_10K.pdf document.\n*   Located \"Total current assets\" with a value of $1.90 billions.\n*   Located \"Total current liabilities\" with a value of $2.42 billions.\n*   Calculated Working Capital: $1.90 billions - $2.42 billions = decrease in $0.52 billions.\n*   American Water Works has negative working capital.\n*   While negative working capital can sometimes indicate potential liquidity issues, it's not necessarily a negative sign for a utility company like American Water Works.\n*   Utility companies often have predictable and stable revenue streams, allowing them to manage with lower levels of working capital.\n*   They typically have lower inventory levels and can efficiently manage accounts receivable due to the essential nature of their services.\n*   Focusing on metrics like cash flow from operations, capital expenditure management, and debt levels provides a more comprehensive view of their financial health.\n\n**Final Answer:** American Water Works has negative working capital of decrease in $0.52 billions. While negative working capital can sometimes be a concern, it is not necessarily a negative indicator for a utility company like American Water Works due to their stable and predictable revenue streams. Metrics like cash flow from operations and management of capital expenditures are often more relevant for assessing the financial health of such companies.\n\n\n",
