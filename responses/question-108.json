  "response": "```results\n[\n  {\n    \"citation\": \"Filename: MGMRESORTS_2022Q4_EARNINGS.pdf, pages: 1-4\",\n    \"reason\": \"Gestell selected this node for containing MGM Resorts International's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, which includes the necessary data to calculate the interest coverage ratio.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n```cot\n1. Correct document and section to analyze: MGMRESORTS 2022Q4 EARNINGS document.  Specifically, the sections detailing FY2022 Adjusted EBIT and annual Interest Expense from the income statement.\n\n2. Detailed analysis and calculations:\n\n*   Locate FY2022 Adjusted EBIT from the income statement within the provided document.\n*   Locate the annual Interest Expense from the income statement within the provided document.\n*   Calculate the interest coverage ratio: Interest Coverage Ratio = FY2022 Adjusted EBIT / Annual Interest Expense.\n*   If the FY2022 Adjusted EBIT is negative, the interest coverage ratio will be negative or zero.  The instructions state to respond with \"As adjusted EBIT is negative, coverage ratio is zero\" if this is the case.\n\n3. Response rules:\n\n*   Follow the specified formatting rules for numbers (dollar amounts, percentages, ratios).\n*   Respond in a concise, bullet-point format.\n*   If the adjusted EBIT is negative, the response should be exactly: \"As adjusted EBIT is negative, coverage ratio is zero\".\n*   No other scenarios or calculations are needed based on the prompt's instructions.\n\n\n```\n\n* The document does not provide a separate line item for Adjusted EBIT.  It only provides Adjusted EBITDAR.\n* Adjusted EBITDAR was $3.50 billions.  Without further information on depreciation, amortization, and rent expense, Adjusted EBIT cannot be calculated.\n\n**Final Answer:** As adjusted EBIT is not provided, the coverage ratio cannot be calculated.\n\n\n",
