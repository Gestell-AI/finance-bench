1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the "JPMORGAN 2021Q1 10Q" document.  Focus on the balance sheet to find the total shareholders' equity and the number of outstanding shares.

2. **Calculations and Analysis:**

* **Locate Shareholders' Equity:** Find the total shareholders' equity value on the balance sheet as of 2021 Q1.  Let's assume this value is represented by the variable `TotalShareholdersEquity`.
* **Locate Number of Outstanding Shares:** Find the number of outstanding shares from the balance sheet or notes to the financial statements. Let's assume this value is represented by the variable `NumberOfOutstandingShares`.
* **Calculate Equity per Share:** Divide the total shareholders' equity by the number of outstanding shares.
    * `EquityPerShare = TotalShareholdersEquity / NumberOfOutstandingShares`
* **State the Result:** Report the calculated `EquityPerShare` value as the amount each shareholder could potentially receive in a liquidation scenario.  Note that this is a simplified calculation and does not account for potential liquidation costs, liabilities exceeding assets (resulting in zero payout), or other complexities of bankruptcy proceedings.

3. **Response Rules:**

* Format the final answer as a dollar amount with two decimal places (e.g., $XX.XX).
* Clearly state that this calculation is a simplified estimation based on the available data and does not account for the complexities of bankruptcy proceedings.
* If the calculation results in a negative value, state that shareholders would receive nothing in a liquidation scenario due to liabilities exceeding assets.
* If the calculation results in a zero value, state that shareholders would receive nothing.

- The document provided states that tangible book value per share was $66.56 as of March 31, 2021 (end of Q1).
- Tangible book value per share represents the net asset value of the company available to common shareholders after all liabilities have been paid off and is often considered a more realistic measure of a company's liquidation value compared to book value per share, as it excludes intangible assets which may be difficult to liquidate.

**Final Answer:** $66.56 per share. This is a simplified estimation based on the available data and does not account for the complexities of bankruptcy proceedings, where the actual amount received could be different.

## Correct Answer

They could receive $66.56 per share.
