1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the AMCOR 2023 10K document, specifically the "Business" section which typically describes the company's operations and industry.  Look for sections describing the company's products, services, and markets.  The "Risk Factors" section might also offer clues about the industry.

2. **Analysis:** Carefully read the descriptions of AMCOR's business activities. Identify the primary products and services offered.  Determine the industry classification based on the nature of these products and services (e.g., packaging, manufacturing, consumer goods, etc.).  Consider any industry classifications mentioned explicitly in the 10K.

3. **Response Rules:**
    * Respond concisely in a bullet point format.
    * State the primary industry AMCOR operates in based on the analysis of the 10K's "Business" and potentially "Risk Factors" sections.
    * If multiple industries are mentioned, prioritize the one described as primary or core to AMCOR's operations.
    * If the 10K doesn't explicitly state the industry, infer it from the description of AMCOR's business activities.
    * The final answer should be a single bullet point clearly stating the industry.
