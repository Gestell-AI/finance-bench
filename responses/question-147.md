1. Analyze Verizon's 2022 10K document, specifically the balance sheets for fiscal years 2021 and 2022.  Locate the "Total Debt" or a similarly named line item representing the company's total debt obligations.

2. **Analysis:**
   * Extract the value of total debt from the 2022 balance sheet.
   * Extract the value of total debt from the 2021 balance sheet.
   * Calculate the change in debt:  Change in Debt = Total Debt (2022) - Total Debt (2021)
   * Calculate the percentage change in debt: Percentage Change = [(Total Debt (2022) - Total Debt (2021)) / Total Debt (2021)] * 100

3. **Response Rules:**
   * Format dollar values according to the provided instructions (millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero).
   * Format percentage changes with 1 decimal place.
   * If the change in debt is zero, state "Verizon's total debt remained unchanged between 2021 and 2022."
   * If the change is positive, state "Verizon increased its debt by $X and Y% between 2021 and 2022."  Replace X with the calculated dollar change and Y with the calculated percentage change.
   * If the change is negative, state "Verizon decreased its debt by $X and Y% between 2021 and 2022." Replace X with the calculated dollar change (presented as a decrease) and Y with the calculated percentage change.
   * Respond using bullet points in a concise and clear manner.  The final answer should include both the dollar and percentage changes.


```

- 2021 Total Debt: $150.868 billion
- 2022 Total Debt: $150.639 billion
- Change in Debt: $150.639 billion - $150.868 billion = decrease in $0.229 billion
- Percentage Change: (decrease in $0.229 billion / $150.868 billion) \* 100 = decrease in 0.2%

**Final Answer:** Verizon decreased its debt by $0.229 billion and 0.2% between 2021 and 2022.

## Correct Answer

No. Verizon's debt decreased by $229 million.
