1. Correct document and section to analyze: AMAZON 2017 10K, specifically the Balance Sheet and Income Statement for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.

2. Detailed analysis and calculations:

* **Step 1: Identify Accounts Payable for FY2016 and FY2017:** Locate the "Accounts payable" line item on the balance sheets for both fiscal years.  Let's assume the following values (replace with actual values from the 10K):
    * Accounts Payable FY2016: $X
    * Accounts Payable FY2017: $Y

* **Step 2: Calculate Average Accounts Payable:**
    * Average Accounts Payable = ($X + $Y) / 2

* **Step 3: Identify Inventory for FY2016 and FY2017:** Locate the "Inventories" line item on the balance sheets for both fiscal years. Let's assume the following values (replace with actual values from the 10K):
    * Inventory FY2016: $A
    * Inventory FY2017: $B

* **Step 4: Calculate Change in Inventory:**
    * Change in Inventory = $B - $A

* **Step 5: Obtain Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2017:** Locate the "Cost of Goods Sold" line item on the income statement for FY2017. Let's assume this value is $C (replace with the actual value from the 10K).

* **Step 6: Calculate the Denominator:**
    * Total Cost = $C + ($B - $A)

* **Step 7: Calculate Days Payable Outstanding (DPO):**
    * DPO = (365 * Average Accounts Payable) / Total Cost
    * Substitute the calculated values from steps 2 and 6 into this formula.

3. Response rules:

*   Use the exact values from AMAZON 2017 10K balance sheet and income statement.
*   Format the final DPO answer to two decimal places.
*   If any of the values are zero, clearly state that there was no change or that the value is zero.
*   Present the final answer as a single number with two decimal places, representing the calculated DPO for Amazon's FY2017.
*   Do not include any additional commentary or interpretation beyond the calculated DPO value.

4. **Calculate Change in Inventory:** Subtract the Inventory value of FY2016 from FY2017.
5. **Identify Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Extract the COGS value for FY2017. _Correction: COGS is found on the Income Statement, not the Balance Sheet._
6. **Calculate the Denominator:** Add the FY2017 COGS and the Change in Inventory.
7. **Calculate DPO:** Multiply 365 by the Average Accounts Payable and then divide by the Denominator.
