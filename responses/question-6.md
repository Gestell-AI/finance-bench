1. **Document and Section:** Analyze document "3M 2023Q2 10Q", specifically the balance sheet for Q2 2023 to extract the values for Total Current Assets, Inventories, and Current Liabilities.

2. **Analysis and Calculations:**

   * **Step 1: Determine Total Current Assets:** Locate the "Total Current Assets" figure from 3M's Q2 2023 balance sheet.  Let's assume this value is X.
   * **Step 2: Subtract Inventories:** Find the "Inventories" value on the same balance sheet. Let's assume this value is Y. Calculate Quick Assets: Quick Assets = X - Y.
   * **Step 3: Identify Current Liabilities:** Locate "Current Liabilities" on the balance sheet. Let's assume this value is Z.
   * **Step 4: Calculate the Quick Ratio:**  Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = (X - Y) / Z.
   * **Step 5: Interpret the Quick Ratio:** If the calculated Quick Ratio is below 1.0, conclude that 3M does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on this metric. If it is 1.0 or above, conclude that 3M has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on this metric.  Format the Quick Ratio to two decimal places as instructed.

3. **Response Rules:**

   * Use bullet points to present the analysis steps.
   * Clearly state the values of X, Y, and Z obtained from the 10-Q.
   * Show the calculation of the Quick Ratio.
   * State the final conclusion regarding 3M's liquidity profile based on the calculated Quick Ratio, following the formatting guidelines (two decimal places for the Quick Ratio).
   * If the necessary data is missing from the 10-Q, state that the calculation cannot be performed and explain why (e.g., missing data points).


```

- Total Current Assets (June 30, 2023): $15754 million (X)
- Total Inventories (June 30, 2023): $5280 million (Y)
- Total Current Liabilities (June 30, 2023): $10936 million (Z)
- Quick Assets = X - Y = $15754 million - $5280 million = $10474 million
- Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities = $10474 million / $10936 million = 0.96

**Final Answer:** 3M's quick ratio for Q2 2023 is 0.96. Since this is below 1.0, 3M does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on this metric.

## Correct Answer

No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark
