```cot
1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the "BLOCK 2016 10K" document. Specifically, focus on the balance sheet for the fiscal year 2016.  Locate the values for "Total Current Assets" and "Total Current Liabilities".

2. **Analysis and Calculation:**

* **Step 1: Locate Total Current Assets:** Find the value reported for "Total Current Assets" on Block's FY2016 balance sheet. Let's assume this value is X.
* **Step 2: Locate Total Current Liabilities:** Find the value reported for "Total Current Liabilities" on Block's FY2016 balance sheet. Let's assume this value is Y.
* **Step 3: Calculate Working Capital Ratio:** Divide Total Current Assets (X) by Total Current Liabilities (Y).
    * Working Capital Ratio = X / Y
* **Step 4: Round the Result:** Round the calculated ratio to two decimal places.

3. **Response Rules:**

*   Format the final answer as a ratio with two decimal places (e.g., 1.23).
*   The response should be a concise bullet point list showing the steps and the final calculated ratio.  No additional commentary is needed.
*   If the values for Total Current Assets or Total Current Liabilities are not available in the document, state that the calculation cannot be performed due to missing data.
