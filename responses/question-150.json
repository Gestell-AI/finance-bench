Correct document and section to analyze: WALMART 2020 10K, specifically the Consolidated Statements of Income (P&L) and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n2. Detailed analysis and calculations:\n\n*   **Step 1: Locate necessary data points.**  Extract the following data from the Walmart 2020 10K:\n    *   Unadjusted Operating Income (or EBIT): This will be found in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Obtain this value for FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020.\n    *   Depreciation and Amortization: This will be found in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Obtain this value for FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020.\n    *   Total Revenue: This will be found in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Obtain this value for FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate unadjusted EBITDA for each year.** For each fiscal year (FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020), perform the following calculation:\n    *   Unadjusted EBITDA = Unadjusted Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the unadjusted EBITDA margin for each year.** For each fiscal year, calculate the EBITDA margin using the following formula:\n    *   Unadjusted EBITDA Margin = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Total Revenue) * 100\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the 3-year average unadjusted EBITDA margin.** Sum the unadjusted EBITDA margins calculated in Step 3 for FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020. Then, divide the sum by 3 to obtain the average.\n\n3. Response rules:\n\n*   Present the final answer as a percentage rounded to one decimal place.\n*   Use Markdown formatting as specified in the provided instructions.  Specifically, format percentages with one decimal place.\n*   If the calculation results in a zero value, state \"nothing happened\".\n*   The response should be concise and presented as bullet points outlining each step.  Do not include example responses.\n\n```\n\n* **FY2018 Unadjusted EBITDA:** $20437 millions + $10529 millions = $30966 millions\n* **FY2018 Unadjusted EBITDA Margin:** ($30966 millions / $500343 millions) * 100 = 6.2%\n* **FY2019 Unadjusted EBITDA:** $21957 millions + $10678 millions = $32635 millions\n* **FY2019 Unadjusted EBITDA Margin:** ($32635 millions / $514405 millions) * 100 = 6.3%\n* **FY2020 Unadjusted EBITDA:** $20568 millions + $10987 millions = $31555 millions\n* **FY2020 Unadjusted EBITDA Margin:** ($31555 millions / $523964 millions) * 100 = 6.0%\n* **3-Year Average Unadjusted EBITDA Margin:** (6.2% + 6.3% + 6.0%) / 3 = 6.2%\n\n**Final Answer:** 6.2%\n\n\n",
