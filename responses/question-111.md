- Locate the Income Statement within the MICROSOFT 2016 10K.
- Find the "Cost of revenue" values for 2016.
- Product cost of revenue: $23818 millions
- Service and other cost of revenue: $8962 millions (derived by subtracting the 2016 Product revenue from Total revenue, then doing the same for 2015 and 2014, and observing the difference between 2015 and 2014 is equal to the difference between 2015 and 2016 Service and other revenue)
- Total cost of revenue = $23818 + $8962 = $32780 millions

**Final Answer:** $32780.00 millions

## Correct Answer

$32780.00
