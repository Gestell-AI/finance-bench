Specifically, locate the income statement for fiscal years 2021 and 2022.  Find the values for \"Income tax expense\" and \"Net income\" for both years.\n\n- Calculations and Analysis:\n\n  1. **FY2021:**\n     * Locate the \"Income tax expense\" and \"Net income\" for FY2021 from the income statement.\n     * Calculate the effective tax rate for FY2021 using the formula:  Effective Tax Rate = (Income Tax Expense / Net Income) * 100%.\n\n  2. **FY2022:**\n     * Locate the \"Income tax expense\" and \"Net income\" for FY2022 from the income statement.\n     * Calculate the effective tax rate for FY2022 using the formula: Effective Tax Rate = (Income Tax Expense / Net Income) * 100%.\n\n  3. **Change Calculation:**\n     * Calculate the percentage change in the effective tax rate between FY2021 and FY2022 using the formula:  Percentage Change = [(FY2022 Effective Tax Rate - FY2021 Effective Tax Rate) / FY2021 Effective Tax Rate] * 100%.\n\n  4. **Dollar Change:** There is no dollar change to calculate in this case.  The effective tax rate is a percentage.\n\n- Response Rules:\n\n  * Report the effective tax rate for both FY2021 and FY2022 as percentages with one decimal place (e.g., 20.0%).\n  * Report the percentage change in the effective tax rate with one decimal place (e.g., 15.0%).\n  * If the percentage change is 0, state \"The effective tax rate remained unchanged between FY2021 and FY2022.\"\n  * Use bullet points to present the information clearly.\n  * Final answer should include both the percentage change and a statement of the tax rates for both years.\n\n\n```\n\n* Corning's effective tax rate for FY2021: 20.2%\n* Corning's effective tax rate for FY2022: 22.9%\n* Change in effective tax rate: (22.9 - 20.2) / 20.2 = 13.4%\n\n**Final Answer:** The effective tax rate increased by 13.4%, from 20.2% in FY2021 to 22.9% in FY2022.\n\n\n",
