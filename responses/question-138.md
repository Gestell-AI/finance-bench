1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the ULTABEAUTY 2023 10K document.  Specifically, focus on the sections detailing acquisitions or business combinations within the Notes to the Financial Statements, Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), or the consolidated financial statements themselves. Look for sections explicitly mentioning acquisitions or purchases of other businesses.

2. **Analysis:**
    * **Identify Acquisition Mentions:** Carefully review the document for any mentions of acquisitions, mergers, or purchases of other companies.  Pay close attention to any descriptions of significant transactions.
    * **Extract Acquisition Details:** For each identified acquisition, extract the following information:
        * **Name of Acquired Company:** The name of the company that Ulta Beauty acquired.
        * **Acquisition Date:** The date of the acquisition (fiscal year 2022 or 2023).
        * **Acquisition Value:** The total purchase price or value of the acquisition (in USD).  If the exact value isn't explicitly stated, note that the value is not available.
    * **Organize Findings:** Create a structured list of acquisitions, clearly separating those from FY2022 and FY2023.

3. **Response Rules:**
    * Format the response as a bulleted list.
    * For each acquisition, present the information in the following format:
        * **FY2023:**
            * *Acquisition Name*: Acquisition Value
        * **FY2022:**
            * *Acquisition Name*: Acquisition Value
    * If no acquisitions are found for a given year, state "No major acquisitions reported for FY[Year]".
    * If the acquisition value is not explicitly stated, indicate "Acquisition value not specified".
    * Follow the specified formatting rules for dollar values (millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero).
    * The response should be concise and clearly structured.  No additional commentary or analysis is needed beyond the requested acquisition details.
