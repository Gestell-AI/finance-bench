Dillon was appointed the new CEO of Foot Locker.\n* Ms. Dillon served as the CEO of Ulta Beauty, a leading beauty retailer in the U.S., from 2013 to 2021.\n* She also served as President and CEO of U.S. Cellular, a telecommunications company, from 2010 to 2013.\n* While both Ulta Beauty and Foot Locker are retail companies, they operate in distinct sectors with different target markets (beauty vs. athletic footwear and apparel).\n* U.S. Cellular operates in a completely different industry (telecommunications) than Foot Locker.\n\n**Final Answer:** While the new CEO has prior experience as CEO of publicly traded companies, her previous CEO roles were not in companies directly comparable to Foot Locker in terms of industry and target market.\n\n\n",
  "answer": "Yes. She was previous CEO of Ulta Beauty which means she had to manage a large retail company that has brick and mortar + online business. So yes she was a CEO in a similar company to Foot Locker before this.",
