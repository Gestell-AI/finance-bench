1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the LOCKHEED MARTIN 2022 10K document. Specifically, focus on the Statement of Income for fiscal years 2020 and 2022 to extract the total revenue figures.

2. **Analysis and Calculations:**

   * **Step 1: Extract Revenue Data:** Locate the total revenue figures for fiscal years 2020 and 2022 from the Statement of Income. Let's assume (replace with actual values from the 10K):
      * FY2020 Total Revenue = $65000.00 millions
      * FY2022 Total Revenue = $74000.00 millions

   * **Step 2: Calculate the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR):** Use the following formula to calculate the 2-year CAGR:

     CAGR = [(Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of years)] - 1

     In this case:

     CAGR = [($74000.00 millions / $65000.00 millions)^(1 / 2)] - 1

     CAGR = [1.13846^(0.5)] - 1

     CAGR = 1.06708 - 1

     CAGR = 0.06708

   * **Step 3: Convert to Percentage:** Multiply the CAGR by 100 to express it as a percentage:

     CAGR (%) = 0.06708 * 100 = 6.7%

3. **Response Rules:**

   * Format the final CAGR as a percentage with one decimal place (6.7%).
   * The response should be concise and clearly state the 2-year total revenue CAGR from FY2020 to FY2022.
   * If the CAGR is 0, state "Nothing happened".
   * The response should be in bullet points.

   *Example Response:*

   * Lockheed Martin's FY2020 Total Revenue: $65000.00 millions
   * Lockheed Martin's FY2022 Total Revenue: $74000.00 millions
   * Calculation: (($74000.00 millions / $65000.00 millions)^(1/2)) -1 = 0.06708
   * 2-Year Revenue CAGR: 6.7%


```

- Lockheed Martin's FY2020 Total Revenue: $65398.00 millions
- Lockheed Martin's FY2022 Total Revenue: $65984.00 millions
- Calculation: (($65984.00 millions / $65398.00 millions)^(1/2)) - 1 = 0.00436
- 2-Year Revenue CAGR: 0.4%

**Final Answer:** 0.4%

## Correct Answer

0.4%
