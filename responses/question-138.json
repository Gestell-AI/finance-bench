Specifically, focus on the sections detailing acquisitions or business combinations within the Notes to the Financial Statements, Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), or the consolidated financial statements themselves. Look for sections explicitly mentioning acquisitions or purchases of other businesses.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n    * **Identify Acquisition Mentions:** Carefully review the document for any mentions of acquisitions, mergers, or purchases of other companies.  Pay close attention to any descriptions of significant transactions.\n    * **Extract Acquisition Details:** For each identified acquisition, extract the following information:\n        * **Name of Acquired Company:** The name of the company that Ulta Beauty acquired.\n        * **Acquisition Date:** The date of the acquisition (fiscal year 2022 or 2023).\n        * **Acquisition Value:** The total purchase price or value of the acquisition (in USD).  If the exact value isn't explicitly stated, note that the value is not available.\n    * **Organize Findings:** Create a structured list of acquisitions, clearly separating those from FY2022 and FY2023.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n    * Format the response as a bulleted list.\n    * For each acquisition, present the information in the following format:\n        * **FY2023:**\n            * *Acquisition Name*: Acquisition Value\n        * **FY2022:**\n            * *Acquisition Name*: Acquisition Value\n    * If no acquisitions are found for a given year, state \"No major acquisitions reported for FY[Year]\".\n    * If the acquisition value is not explicitly stated, indicate \"Acquisition value not specified\".\n    * Follow the specified formatting rules for dollar values (millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero).\n    * The response should be concise and clearly structured.  No additional commentary or analysis is needed beyond the requested acquisition details.\n\n\n```\n\n* **FY2023:** No major acquisitions reported for FY2023.\n* **FY2022:** No major acquisitions reported for FY2022.\n\n**Final Answer:** No major acquisitions were reported for either FY2023 or FY2022.\n\n\n",
