Let's assume this value is X.\n\n   * **Step 2: Find FY2016 Total Assets:** Locate the total assets figure for the fiscal year 2016 from Coca-Cola's balance sheet. Let's assume this value is Y.\n\n   * **Step 3: Find FY2017 Total Assets:** Locate the total assets figure for the fiscal year 2017 from Coca-Cola's balance sheet. Let's assume this value is Z.\n\n   * **Step 4: Calculate Average Total Assets:** Calculate the average of total assets for FY2016 and FY2017 using the formula: (Y + Z) / 2 = Average Total Assets. Let's assume this value is A.\n\n   * **Step 5: Calculate Return on Assets (ROA):** Calculate the ROA using the formula: ROA = (FY2017 Net Income) / (Average Total Assets) = X / A.  Round the result to two decimal places.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n   * Present the final ROA as a percentage with one decimal place (e.g., 12.3%).\n   * If the calculated ROA is 0, state \"Nothing happened\".\n   * If any of the required financial data (net income, FY2016 total assets, FY2017 total assets) is missing or cannot be found, clearly state this and explain why the calculation cannot be performed.  Do not attempt to estimate missing values.\n   * The response should be concise and in bullet points.  The final answer should be clearly marked.\n\n```\n\n*   **FY2017 Net Income:** $1248 millions (Located on the Income Statement)\n*   **FY2016 Total Assets:** $87270 millions (Located on the Balance Sheet)\n*   **FY2017 Total Assets:** $87896 millions (Located on the Balance Sheet)\n*   **Average Total Assets:** ($87270 + $87896)/2 = $87583 millions\n*   **FY2017 ROA:** ($1248/$87583) * 100% = 1.4%\n\n**Final Answer:** 1.4%\n\n\n",
