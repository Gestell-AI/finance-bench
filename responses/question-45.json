Analyze the AMERICANEXPRESS 2022 10K document, specifically the sections discussing customer retention, card member growth, or similar metrics.  Look for tables or figures showing the number of card members at the beginning and end of 2022, or percentage changes in card membership.  Also, examine the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) for qualitative commentary on customer retention.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n\n*   Locate the number of card members at the beginning and end of 2022.  This information might be presented as a total number of card members or as a change in the number of card members.\n*   If the total number of card members is provided for both periods, calculate the percentage change using the following formula:\n    *   Percentage Change = [(Ending Number of Card Members - Beginning Number of Card Members) / Beginning Number of Card Members] * 100\n*   If only the change in the number of card members is provided, use that figure to calculate the percentage change based on the total number of card members at the beginning of the year.\n*   Examine the MD&A for any qualitative statements about customer retention.  Look for phrases indicating whether retention was strong, weak, or stable.  Note any specific factors mentioned that influenced retention rates.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Present the findings in a concise, bullet-point format.\n*   If the document provides the total number of card members at the beginning and end of 2022, report both the absolute change (increase or decrease) and the percentage change in card membership.  Format the absolute change as a dollar value increase or decrease (e.g., increase of $100.00 millions) and the percentage change as a percentage (e.g., 10.0%).\n*   If only the percentage change is provided, report that percentage change.\n*   If the document does not provide quantitative data on card member retention, summarize the qualitative statements from the MD&A regarding retention.\n*   If no information on card member retention is found, state that the document does not contain information on American Express's ability to retain card members during 2022.\n*   Adhere to the specified formatting rules for dollar values, percentages, and ratios.  The final answer should include both the $ and % changes if available.  If the final answer is 0, state that nothing happened.\n\n\n```\n\n*   American Express had 76.7 million proprietary cards-in-force worldwide at the end of 2022.\n*   American Express had 72.9 million proprietary cards-in-force worldwide at the end of 2021.\n*   Change: 76.7 million - 72.9 million = 3.8 million\n*   Percentage Change: (3.8 million / 72.9 million) * 100% = 5.2%\n\n**Final Answer:** American Express increased its card members by 3.8 million, a 5.2% increase.\n\n\n",
