1. Analyze the "JOHNSON JOHNSON 2022 10K" document, specifically focusing on the sections detailing gross margin for FY2022 and any accompanying explanations or discussions of changes in gross margin.  Also, review sections discussing the company's overall financial performance and strategy to assess the usefulness of gross margin as a metric for Johnson & Johnson.

2. **Analysis:**

*   **Gross Margin Change Calculation:** Determine the gross margin for FY2022 and the preceding fiscal year (FY2021). Calculate the percentage change in gross margin using the formula: `[(FY2022 Gross Margin - FY2021 Gross Margin) / FY2021 Gross Margin] * 100%`.  Express the result as a percentage with one decimal place.  If the change is a decrease, state it as a decrease in X%.
*   **Identify Drivers of Change:** Examine the 10K's discussion of results of operations, management's discussion and analysis (MD&A), and any notes to the financial statements. Look for explanations of changes in sales revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), pricing strategies, changes in product mix, impact of acquisitions or divestitures, and any other factors mentioned as influencing gross margin.  List these factors as bullet points.
*   **Assess Usefulness of Gross Margin:**  Evaluate whether gross margin is a useful metric for Johnson & Johnson. Consider the following:
    *   **Company Complexity:** Johnson & Johnson operates in diverse sectors (pharmaceuticals, medical devices, consumer health).  Does a single gross margin figure adequately capture the performance of these diverse segments?  If not, explain why.
    *   **Cost Structure:**  Is COGS a significant portion of Johnson & Johnson's total costs?  If not, the gross margin might not be as informative as other metrics.
    *   **Industry Benchmarks:** Compare Johnson & Johnson's gross margin to those of its competitors.  Is it significantly higher or lower?  What does this suggest about its competitive position and pricing power?
    *   **Alternative Metrics:** Are there other, more relevant metrics (e.g., segment-specific margins, operating income, EBITDA) that provide a more comprehensive view of Johnson & Johnson's financial performance?  If so, explain why.  Consider both arguments for and against the usefulness of gross margin.

3. **Response Rules:**

*   Present the analysis in a concise, bulleted list.
*   Quantify the gross margin change with a percentage, following the specified formatting rules.
*   Clearly state the factors identified as driving the gross margin change.
*   Provide a reasoned assessment of the usefulness of gross margin as a metric for Johnson & Johnson, considering both sides of the argument.  If gross margin is deemed not useful, explain why and suggest alternative metrics.
*   Format all numerical values according to the provided guidelines.
*   If the gross margin change is zero, state that "nothing happened."

- **2021 Gross Margin:** 68.2% ($63.920B/$93.775B)
- **Gross Margin Change:** Decrease in 0.9%

**Factors Driving Gross Margin Change:**

- One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs.
- Currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment.
- Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments.
- These negative impacts were partially offset by supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment.

**Usefulness of Gross Margin for Johnson & Johnson:**

While gross margin provides a high-level view of profitability after deducting direct costs, its usefulness for a complex conglomerate like Johnson & Johnson is limited. Here's why:

- **Segment Diversity:** Johnson & Johnson operates across pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health. These segments have vastly different cost structures and profit margins. A single gross margin figure obscures the performance of individual segments, which is crucial for understanding the overall business.
- **More Relevant Metrics:** Segment-specific margins, operating income, and EBITDA provide a more granular and insightful view of Johnson & Johnson's performance. These metrics allow for comparisons within each industry segment and better reflect the underlying profitability of each business unit.

**Final Answer:** Gross margin decreased by 0.9%. While gross margin provides a basic measure of profitability, it is not the most useful metric for a diversified company like Johnson & Johnson. Segment-specific data and other profitability measures like operating income and EBITDA offer more insightful analyses.

## Correct Answer

For FY22, JnJ had changes in gross margin due to: One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs, Currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment, Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments, partially offset by Supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment.
