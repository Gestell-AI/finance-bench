1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the GENERAL MILLS 2022 10K document. Specifically, focus on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statements of Income to extract the necessary data for the retention ratio calculation.

2. **Detailed Analysis and Calculations:**

   * **Step 1: Locate Net Income:** Find "Net income attributable to General Mills Inc." from the Consolidated Statements of Income for FY2022.  Let's assume this value is X.

   * **Step 2: Locate Dividends Paid:** Find "Cash dividends paid" from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for FY2022. Let's assume this value is Y.

   * **Step 3: Calculate Retention Ratio:** Apply the formula: Retention Ratio = (Net Income - Dividends Paid) / Net Income = (X - Y) / X.  Perform this calculation using the numerical values obtained in Steps 1 and 2.  Round the final result to two decimal places.

3. **Response Rules:**

   * Present the final retention ratio as a decimal rounded to two decimal places.
   * If the calculated retention ratio is 0, state "Nothing happened".
   * The response should be concise and formatted as a bullet point list, clearly showing each step of the calculation.  Include the values of X and Y before calculating the final answer.
   * Do not include commas in numerical values.  Format dollar amounts according to the provided instructions (millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero).  Percentages should be formatted to one decimal place.

```

- **Net Income (X):** $2707.30 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Income)
- **Dividends Paid (Y):** $1244 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)
- **Retention Ratio:** (X - Y) / X = (2707.30 - 1244) / 2707.30 = 0.54

**Final Answer:** 0.54

## Correct Answer

0.54
