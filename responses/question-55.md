1. Analyze the BESTBUY 2024Q2 10Q document, specifically the sections detailing store count or similar metrics for Q2 of FY2024 and FY2023.  Look for tables or textual descriptions providing the number of Best Buy stores in operation during each period.

2. Extract the number of Best Buy stores for Q2 FY2024 and Q2 FY2023 from the identified section. Let's say:

    * Q2 FY2024 Store Count: X
    * Q2 FY2023 Store Count: Y

3. Calculate the change in the number of stores:

    * Change in Store Count = X - Y

4. Calculate the percentage change (if applicable):

    * Percentage Change = ((X - Y) / Y) * 100%

5. Formulate the response:

    * If X = Y, the response should be: "There was no change in the number of Best Buy stores between Q2 of FY2024 and FY2023."
    * If X > Y, the response should be: "The number of Best Buy stores increased by [X - Y] stores between Q2 of FY2024 and FY2023, representing a [Percentage Change]% increase."
    * If X < Y, the response should be: "The number of Best Buy stores decreased by [Y - X] stores between Q2 of FY2024 and FY2023, representing a [Percentage Change]% decrease."

    * Ensure that all numerical values are formatted according to the provided guidelines (no commas in dollar values, millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero, percentages with 1 decimal place, ratios as specified).  The response should be concise and presented as bullet points.

```
