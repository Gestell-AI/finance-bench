Correct document and section to analyze: AMD 2015 10K, specifically the Statement of Cash Flows and the Income Statement.\n\n2. Detailed analysis and calculations:\n\n*   **Locate Depreciation and Amortization (D&A):** Find the D&A figure from the AMD 2015 10K's Statement of Cash Flows.  Let's assume this value is X.  The exact number needs to be extracted from the document.\n\n*   **Locate Revenue:** Find the total revenue figure for FY2015 from the AMD 2015 10K's Income Statement. Let's assume this value is Y. The exact number needs to be extracted from the document.\n\n*   **Calculate D&A % Margin:** Divide the D&A (X) by the Revenue (Y) and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\n    D&A % Margin = (X / Y) * 100\n\n3. Rules for responding:\n\n*   Extract the values of D&A and Revenue from the specified financial statements in the AMD 2015 10K.\n*   Perform the calculation as described above.\n*   Format the final answer as a percentage with one decimal place (e.g., 6.9%).\n*   If the calculated D&A % margin is 0, respond with \"Nothing happened\".\n*   Present the final answer concisely as a bullet point.\n*   Do not include commas in numerical values.  Follow all formatting rules specified in the `Response Instructions`.\n\n```\n\n*   Depreciation and amortization expense for FY2015: $167 million (from the Statement of Cash Flows)\n*   AMD's FY2015 Revenue: $3991 million (from the Income Statement)\n*   D&A % Margin = (167 / 3991) * 100 = 4.2%\n\n**Final Answer:** 4.2%\n\n\n",
