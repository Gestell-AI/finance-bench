Analyze the BESTBUY 2023 10K document, specifically the income statement sections for multiple years to obtain the gross margin data.\n\n2. **Data Extraction and Calculation:**\n   * Extract Best Buy's gross margin percentage for each of the past several years from the income statement.  The exact number of years will depend on the data available in the 10K.\n   * Calculate the year-over-year percentage change in gross margin for each year.  The formula is: `((Current Year Gross Margin - Previous Year Gross Margin) / Previous Year Gross Margin) * 100`.\n   * Determine if any year-over-year change exceeds 2%.\n\n3. **Analysis and Response:**\n   * If any year-over-year change in gross margin exceeds 2%, then state that Best Buy's gross margins are not historically consistent, providing the specific years and percentage changes that exceed the threshold.\n   * If no year-over-year change exceeds 2%, then state that Best Buy's gross margins are historically consistent, within the defined fluctuation range.\n   * If gross margin is not a relevant metric for Best Buy (which is unlikely for a retailer), then state that gross margin is not a relevant metric and explain why.  This would require additional analysis of Best Buy's business model and financial reporting to justify this conclusion.  For example, if Best Buy's business model heavily relies on services and other non-product revenue streams, then gross margin might not be the most appropriate metric to assess overall profitability.\n\n4. **Response Rules:**\n   * Follow the specified formatting rules for dollar values, percentages, and ratios.\n   * Present the analysis in a concise, bulleted list.\n   * The final answer should clearly state whether Best Buy's gross margins are historically consistent or not, based on the 2% fluctuation threshold.  Include specific years and percentage changes as evidence.  If gross margin is deemed irrelevant, clearly explain why.\n   * If no changes occurred, state \"nothing happened\".\n\n\n```\n\n* 2021 Gross Profit Margin: $10573 / $47262 = 22.4%\n* 2022 Gross Profit Margin: $11640 / $51761 = 22.5%\n* 2023 Gross Profit Margin: $9912 / $46298 = 21.4%\n* 2021-2022 Change: (22.5% - 22.4%) / 22.4% = 0.5%\n* 2022-2023 Change: (21.4% - 22.5%) / 22.5% = -4.9%\n\n**Final Answer:** Best Buy's gross margins are not historically consistent.  From 2022 to 2023, gross margin decreased by 4.9%, exceeding the 2% threshold.\n\n\n",
  "answer": "Yes, the margins have been consistent, there has been a minor decline of 1.1% in gross margins between FY2022 and FY2023.",
