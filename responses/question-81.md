1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the FOOTLOCKER 2022 8K dated-2022-05-20 document. Focus on the section detailing the voting results for board member nominees.  This will likely be in a section describing the shareholder meeting or election results.

2. **Analysis:**
   * **Locate Voting Results:** Find the table or section that presents the voting results for each board member nominee.  This will typically show the number of votes "for" and "against" each candidate.
   * **Calculate Percentage Against:** For each nominee, calculate the percentage of votes against their nomination.  Use the formula: `(Votes Against / (Votes For + Votes Against)) * 100%`.
   * **Identify Nominees with Substantially More Votes Against:** Compare the percentage of votes against each nominee.  Determine if any nominee has a significantly higher percentage of votes against them compared to the others.  "Substantially more" is subjective and requires judgment based on the context of the voting results. A difference of 10% or more could be considered substantial, but this threshold should be adjusted based on the specific numbers in the document.

3. **Response Rules:**
   * Use bullet points to present the findings.
   * If no nominee had substantially more votes against them than others, state: "No board member nominee had substantially more votes against joining than the other nominees."
   * If one or more nominees had substantially more votes against them, list them and state the percentage of votes against each.  Use the specified formatting for percentages (one decimal place).  Clearly define what constitutes "substantially more" in the response.  For example: "Nominee X had substantially more votes against their nomination (15.2%) compared to other nominees (all below 5%)."
   * The final answer should clearly state whether any nominee had substantially more votes against their nomination than others.
