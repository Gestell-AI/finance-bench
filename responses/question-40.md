1. **Document and Section:** AMERICANEXPRESS 2022 10K,  The section describing American Express's geographic operations. This is likely to be found in the "Business Overview" or "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" sections, or potentially within a dedicated geographic segment reporting section.


2. **Analysis:**
   * Review the specified 10-K document to identify sections discussing American Express's geographic operations.
   * Look for tables or textual descriptions that break down revenue, customer base, or other key metrics by geographic region.  Pay close attention to how the company segments its geographic operations (e.g., by country, region, or continent).
   * List the identified geographies, noting any significant distinctions in how the company categorizes them.  If the 10-K provides quantitative data on the relative importance of each geography (e.g., revenue contribution), include that information as well.


3. **Response Rules:**
   * Present the geographies as a bulleted list.
   * If quantitative data (e.g., revenue percentages) is available, include it alongside each geography.  Format numbers according to the provided instructions (e.g., percentages with one decimal place).
   * If the document does not explicitly list geographies, state that the information is not available.
   * If the document mentions geographies but does not provide a comprehensive list, state the geographies mentioned and note the incompleteness of the information.
   * The response should be concise and clearly formatted in markdown.  No additional commentary or analysis beyond what is directly stated in the 10-K is needed.
