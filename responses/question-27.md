1. Analyze the AMCOR 2023 10K document, specifically focusing on the income statement to find the gross margin for FY2023 and the preceding fiscal year.

2. **Detailed Analysis:**

   * Locate the gross margin percentage for FY2023 and the previous fiscal year from the income statement within the 10K.
   * Calculate the percentage change in gross margin using the following formula:
     `Percentage Change = [(Gross Margin FY2023 - Gross Margin Previous Year) / Gross Margin Previous Year] * 100`
   * Determine if the percentage change represents an improvement (positive value) or a decline (negative value).
   * Assess whether gross margin is a useful metric for evaluating AMCOR's performance. Consider factors such as the nature of AMCOR's business (packaging), its cost structure, and the industry's typical use of gross margin as a key performance indicator.  If it is not useful, explain why, considering factors like the impact of raw material costs, manufacturing processes, and pricing strategies on gross margin.  Consider both sides of the argument.

3. **Response Rules:**

   * Respond in a concise, clearly formatted markdown list.
   * State whether AMCOR's gross margin improved or declined in FY2023.
   * If there was a change, provide the percentage change formatted to one decimal place.
   * If gross margin is deemed not useful, explicitly state this and provide a detailed explanation of why, considering both arguments for and against its usefulness in this context.
   * If there was no change, state that nothing happened.
   * The final answer should include both the $ and % changes, but since the prompt only asks for % change, only the % change needs to be included.  The prompt states that the correct answer is a percentage change, so only the percentage change should be included.

```
