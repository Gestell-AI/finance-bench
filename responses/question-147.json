Analyze Verizon's 2022 10K document, specifically the balance sheets for fiscal years 2021 and 2022.  Locate the \"Total Debt\" or a similarly named line item representing the company's total debt obligations.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n   * Extract the value of total debt from the 2022 balance sheet.\n   * Extract the value of total debt from the 2021 balance sheet.\n   * Calculate the change in debt:  Change in Debt = Total Debt (2022) - Total Debt (2021)\n   * Calculate the percentage change in debt: Percentage Change = [(Total Debt (2022) - Total Debt (2021)) / Total Debt (2021)] * 100\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n   * Format dollar values according to the provided instructions (millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero).\n   * Format percentage changes with 1 decimal place.\n   * If the change in debt is zero, state \"Verizon's total debt remained unchanged between 2021 and 2022.\"\n   * If the change is positive, state \"Verizon increased its debt by $X and Y% between 2021 and 2022.\"  Replace X with the calculated dollar change and Y with the calculated percentage change.\n   * If the change is negative, state \"Verizon decreased its debt by $X and Y% between 2021 and 2022.\" Replace X with the calculated dollar change (presented as a decrease) and Y with the calculated percentage change.\n   * Respond using bullet points in a concise and clear manner.  The final answer should include both the dollar and percentage changes.\n\n\n```\n\n* 2021 Total Debt: $150.868 billion\n* 2022 Total Debt: $150.639 billion\n* Change in Debt: $150.639 billion - $150.868 billion = decrease in $0.229 billion\n* Percentage Change: (decrease in $0.229 billion / $150.868 billion) * 100 = decrease in 0.2%\n\n**Final Answer:** Verizon decreased its debt by $0.229 billion and 0.2% between 2021 and 2022.\n\n\n",
