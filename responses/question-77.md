1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the CVSHEALTH 2022 10K document.  Specifically, focus on the sections containing the Balance Sheet (for Total Assets and Fixed Assets), the Income Statement (for Total Revenue), and the Statement of Cash Flows (for Capital Expenditures).

2. **Analysis and Calculations:**

   * **Step 1: Gather Data** Locate the following figures from the CVSHEALTH 2022 10K financial statements for Fiscal Year 2022:
      * Total Assets:  Find this on the Balance Sheet.
      * Total Revenue: Find this on the Income Statement.
      * Capital Expenditures (CapEx): Find this on the Statement of Cash Flows.
      * Fixed Assets (Property, Plant, and Equipment - PP&E): Find this on the Balance Sheet.  If only Net PP&E is available, use that.

   * **Step 2: Calculate Capital Intensity Ratio:**
      * Capital Intensity Ratio = Total Assets / Total Revenue.  Perform this calculation using the values obtained in Step 1.

   * **Step 3: Calculate CapEx/Revenue Ratio:**
      * CapEx/Revenue Ratio = Capital Expenditures / Total Revenue. Perform this calculation using the values obtained in Step 1.  Convert the result to a percentage.

   * **Step 4: Calculate Fixed Assets/Total Assets Ratio:**
      * Fixed Assets/Total Assets Ratio = Fixed Assets / Total Assets. Perform this calculation using the values obtained in Step 1. Convert the result to a percentage.

   * **Step 5: Calculate Return on Assets (ROA):**
      * ROA = Net Income / Total Assets.  Obtain Net Income from the Income Statement. Perform this calculation. Convert the result to a percentage.

   * **Step 6: Interpret Results:** Based on the calculated ratios from Steps 2-5, determine if CVS Health is capital-intensive. A high Capital Intensity Ratio, CapEx/Revenue Ratio, and Fixed Assets/Total Assets Ratio, coupled with a low ROA, would suggest a capital-intensive business.  Consider industry benchmarks for comparison if available within the 10K or from external research.


3. **Response Rules:**

   * Use bullet points to present the findings.
   * Report the Capital Intensity Ratio, CapEx/Revenue Ratio (as a percentage), Fixed Assets/Total Assets Ratio (as a percentage), and ROA (as a percentage), all formatted according to the provided guidelines.
   * Conclude with a statement indicating whether CVS Health is capital-intensive based on the calculated ratios and analysis, justifying the conclusion.  If any of the required data is missing, state that the analysis cannot be performed due to insufficient data.
   * If all ratios are 0, state that "nothing happened".
   * The final answer should include both the $ and % changes (although these are not applicable in this specific case, as we are not comparing to a previous period).  Instead, focus on the interpretation of the ratios.


```

- Total Assets (2022): $228275.00 million
- Total Revenue (2022): $322467.00 million
- Capital Expenditures (2022): $2727.00 million
- Net Fixed Assets (2022): $12873.00 million
- Net Income (2022): $4165.00 million

- Capital Intensity Ratio (2022) = Total Assets / Total Revenue = $228275.00 million / $322467.00 million = 0.71
- CapEx/Revenue Ratio (2022) = Capital Expenditures / Total Revenue = $2727.00 million / $322467.00 million = 0.8%
- Fixed Assets/Total Assets Ratio (2022) = Net Fixed Assets / Total Assets = $12873.00 million / $228275.00 million = 5.6%
- Return on Assets (ROA) (2022) = Net Income / Total Assets = $4165.00 million / $228275.00 million = 1.8%

**Final Answer:** Based on the calculated ratios for FY2022, CVS Health does not appear to be highly capital-intensive. While its capital intensity ratio is 0.71, indicating that it requires a significant amount of assets to generate revenue, its CapEx/Revenue ratio is relatively low at 0.8%, suggesting that it doesn't reinvest heavily in fixed assets. Furthermore, the Fixed Assets/Total Assets ratio of 5.6% is low, indicating that fixed assets comprise a small portion of total assets. The ROA of 1.8% is modest. These figures suggest that CVS Health's business model relies less on physical capital and more on other resources, such as its extensive retail network and pharmacy benefit management operations.

## Correct Answer

Yes, CVS Health requires an extensive asset base to operate, which is evident from its ROA of only 1.82% in 2022 and 3.39% in 2021, though it should be noted that a significant portion of this asset base is goodwill, and CVS's fixed assets/total assets ratio is on the lower side of 5.6%.
