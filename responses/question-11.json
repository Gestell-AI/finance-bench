Specifically, examine the Statement of Cash Flows to find \"Cash from operations\" for FY2015 and the Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet) to find \"Total Current Liabilities\" for FY2015.\n\n2. **Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n* **Step 1: Locate Cash from Operations:** Find the value for \"Cash from operations\" in the Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal year 2015.  Let's assume this value is X.\n\n* **Step 2: Locate Total Current Liabilities:** Find the value for \"Total Current Liabilities\" on the Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet) for the fiscal year 2015. Let's assume this value is Y.\n\n* **Step 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:** Divide the value obtained in Step 1 (\"Cash from operations,\" X) by the value obtained in Step 2 (\"Total Current Liabilities,\" Y).\n\n   Operating Cash Flow Ratio = X / Y\n\n* **Step 4: Round the Result:** Round the calculated ratio to two decimal places.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Format the final answer as a ratio with two decimal places (e.g., 1.23).\n*   If either \"Cash from operations\" or \"Total Current Liabilities\" is not found in the specified financial statements, state that the calculation cannot be performed due to missing data.\n*   The response should be concise and clearly present the calculated ratio.  No additional commentary is needed beyond the calculated value.\n\n```\n\n* Locate \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" in the 2015 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: $1469.5 millions\n* Locate \"Total current liabilities\" in the 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheets: $2213.56 millions\n* Divide cash from operations by current liabilities: $1469.5 millions / $2213.56 millions = 0.66\n* Final Answer: 0.66\n\n\n",
