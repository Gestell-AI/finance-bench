Analyze the CVSHEALTH 2022 10K document, specifically the Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal year 2022, and the section detailing dividends paid.  Focus on the quarterly breakdown if available, or the overall fiscal year data to infer Q2 dividend payments.\n\n2. **Detailed Analysis:**\n   * Locate the \"Statement of Cash Flows\" within the 10K.\n   * Find the section related to cash flows from financing activities.\n   * Look for a line item explicitly mentioning \"Dividends paid\" or a similar description.\n   * If a quarterly breakdown is provided, identify the amount paid during Q2 of FY2022. If not, examine the total dividends paid for the fiscal year.  If the total dividends are non-zero, it is likely that dividends were paid in Q2, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the notes to the financial statements.  If the total dividends are zero, then no dividends were paid in Q2.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n   * Respond with a concise statement confirming or denying whether CVS Health paid dividends to common shareholders in Q2 of FY2022.\n   * If dividends were paid, state the amount paid in Q2 (if available) or indicate that dividends were paid during the fiscal year, implying Q2 payment.  If no dividends were paid, state this clearly.\n   * Follow the specified formatting rules for dollar amounts and percentages (not applicable in this case, as the prompt does not request percentage change).\n   * The response should be a single bullet point.\n\n```\n\n* CVS Health paid $0.55 per share in dividends each quarter of FY2022.\n\n**Final Answer:** CVS Health paid dividends in Q2 FY2022.\n\n\n",
