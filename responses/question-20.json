Specifically, focus on the Statement of Income (also known as the Income Statement) for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.  Locate the \"Net sales\" or \"Total revenues\" line item for both years.\n\n2. **Analysis and Calculation:**\n\n* **Step 1: Find Net Sales for FY2016:** Locate the \"Net sales\" figure for fiscal year 2016 from the income statement. Let's assume this value is X.\n* **Step 2: Find Net Sales for FY2017:** Locate the \"Net sales\" figure for fiscal year 2017 from the income statement. Let's assume this value is Y.\n* **Step 3: Calculate the change in revenue:**  Subtract the FY2016 net sales from the FY2017 net sales:  Change = Y - X\n* **Step 4: Calculate the percentage change:** Divide the change in revenue by the FY2016 net sales and multiply by 100: Percentage Change = [(Y - X) / X] * 100\n* **Step 5: Round the percentage change:** Round the result from Step 4 to one decimal place.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Format the percentage change with one decimal place (e.g., 20.5%).\n*   If the percentage change is 0, state \"Nothing happened\".\n*   Present the final answer as a concise bullet point, including both the dollar change (from Step 3) and the percentage change (from Step 5).  Use the specified formatting for dollar values and percentages as detailed in the `Response Instructions`.  For example:\n    * Revenue increased by $100.00 millions (20.5%)\n    * Revenue decreased by $100.00 millions (-20.5%)\n    * Nothing happened\n\n\n```\n\n* 2016 Net Sales: $135,987 million\n* 2017 Net Sales: $177,866 million\n* Change in Revenue: $177,866 million - $135,987 million = $41,879 million\n* Percentage Change in Revenue: ($41,879 million / $135,987 million) * 100% = 30.8%\n\n**Final Answer:** Revenue increased by $41,879.00 millions (30.8%)\n\n\n",
