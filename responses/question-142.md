1. Analyze document `ULTABEAUTY 2023Q4 EARNINGS`, specifically the income statement for fiscal year 2023 (which corresponds to the 12 months ended January 28, 2023, as noted in the provided answer).  Locate the values for "Wages expense" and "Net sales" for both FY2022 and FY2023.

2. **Calculations:**

   * **FY2022:**
      * Obtain the "Wages expense" value for FY2022 from the income statement.
      * Obtain the "Net sales" value for FY2022 from the income statement.
      * Calculate the wages expense as a percentage of net sales for FY2022:  (Wages expense FY2022 / Net sales FY2022) * 100%

   * **FY2023:**
      * Obtain the "Wages expense" value for FY2023 from the income statement.
      * Obtain the "Net sales" value for FY2023 from the income statement.
      * Calculate the wages expense as a percentage of net sales for FY2023: (Wages expense FY2023 / Net sales FY2023) * 100%

   * **Comparison:**
      * Subtract the FY2022 percentage from the FY2023 percentage to determine the change: FY2023 Percentage - FY2022 Percentage.  This will give a numerical value representing the increase or decrease.
      * Calculate the percentage change: [(FY2023 Percentage - FY2022 Percentage) / FY2022 Percentage] * 100%

3. **Response Rules:**

   * State whether wages expense as a percent of net sales increased or decreased in FY2023 based on the calculation in step 2.
   * Report the numerical change and the percentage change according to the formatting guidelines provided in the `Response Instructions`.  Use the correct formatting for dollar values, percentages, and ratios.
   * If the change is zero, explicitly state that "nothing happened".
