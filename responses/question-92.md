1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the "JOHNSON JOHNSON 2023 8K dated-2023-08-30" document. Focus on the sections detailing the separation of the Consumer Health business segment and any related financial impacts, particularly the gain or loss resulting from the separation.  Look for sections discussing the transaction's financial results, including income statements, balance sheets, or press releases included within the 8-K filing.

2. **Analysis and Calculation:**
   * Carefully review the 8-K filing to identify any explicit mention of a gain from the separation of the Consumer Health business segment.
   * Look for numerical figures presented in tables or within the text that represent the gain.  The gain might be explicitly labeled or described as "gain on sale," "proceeds from sale," or a similar term.
   * If the gain is not explicitly stated, look for information that allows for its calculation. This might involve comparing the book value of the Consumer Health segment before the separation to the proceeds received from the sale or spin-off.  The difference would represent the gain.
   * Pay close attention to any adjustments or one-time events related to the separation that might affect the calculation of the gain.

3. **Response Rules:**
   * Present the gain amount in dollars, following the specified formatting rules (e.g., $100.00 millions, $10.0 billions).  If the gain is zero, state "Nothing happened".
   * Do not include a percentage change as a percentage change is not requested in the prompt.
   * If the gain cannot be determined from the provided document, state that the information is not available.  Clearly explain why the information cannot be extracted.
   * The response should be concise and presented as a bullet point.
