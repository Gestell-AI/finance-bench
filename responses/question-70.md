1. **Document and Section:** COCACOLA 2022 10K, Cash Flow Statement and Income Statement.  Specifically, we need the "Cash flows from financing activities" section of the cash flow statement to find "Total cash dividends paid" and the "Net income attributable to shareholders" from the income statement.

2. **Analysis and Calculations:**

* **Step 1: Locate Total Cash Dividends Paid:** Find the value for "Total cash dividends paid" within the "Cash flows from financing activities" section of Coca-Cola's 2022 10-K cash flow statement. Let's assume this value is X.

* **Step 2: Locate Net Income Attributable to Shareholders:** Find the value for "Net income attributable to shareholders" in Coca-Cola's 2022 10-K income statement. Let's assume this value is Y.

* **Step 3: Calculate Dividend Payout Ratio:** Use the formula: Dividend Payout Ratio = (Total Cash Dividends Paid) / (Net Income Attributable to Shareholders) = X / Y.  Calculate this ratio.

* **Step 4: Round the Result:** Round the calculated ratio to two decimal places.

3. **Response Rules:**

* Format the final answer as a ratio with two decimal places (e.g., 0.75).
* If the calculated ratio is 0, respond with "Nothing happened".
* Present the final answer concisely as a bullet point.  No additional commentary is needed beyond the calculated ratio.

- Locate "Total cash dividends paid" in the Cash Flow Statement: $7600.00 millions
- Locate "Net income attributable to shareowners" in the Income Statement: $9800.00 millions
- Calculate the Dividend Payout Ratio: $7600.00 millions / $9800.00 millions = 0.78

**Final Answer:** 0.78
