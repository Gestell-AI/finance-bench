1. Correct document and section to analyze: MGMRESORTS 2020 10K, Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of Income.  Specifically, we need to extract Capital Expenditures (CapEx) from the Statement of Cash Flows and Revenue from the Statement of Income for fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020.

2. Detailed analysis and calculations:

* **Step 1: Extract CapEx and Revenue Data:** Locate the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of Income for FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020 within the MGMRESORTS 2020 10K filing. Extract the values for Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Revenue (Total Revenues or Net Sales) for each year.

* **Step 2: Calculate CapEx as a % of Revenue for each year:** For each fiscal year (FY2018, FY2019, FY2020), calculate the percentage of CapEx to Revenue using the following formula:

   `(CapEx / Revenue) * 100`

* **Step 3: Calculate the 3-year average:** Sum the three percentages calculated in Step 2, then divide by 3 to obtain the average percentage.

3. Response rules:

* Respond in cleanly formatted Markdown using bullet points.
* Present the final answer as a percentage rounded to one decimal place.  For example: "10.1%"
* If the calculation results in a zero, state "Nothing happened".
* Do not include any additional commentary or interpretation beyond the requested calculation.

```

- **FY2018:**

  - CapEx: $739 million (from the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section)
  - Revenue: $11763.096 million (from the "Results of Operations" section)
  - CapEx as % of Revenue: (739 / 11763.096) \* 100 = 6.3%

- **FY2019:**

  - CapEx: $271 million (from the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section)
  - Revenue: $12899.672 million (from the "Results of Operations" section)
  - CapEx as % of Revenue: (271 / 12899.672) \* 100 = 2.1%

- **FY2020:**

  - CapEx: $271 million (from the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section)
  - Revenue: $5162.082 million (from the "Results of Operations" section)
  - CapEx as % of Revenue: (271 / 5162.082) \* 100 = 5.2%

- **3-Year Average:** (6.3% + 2.1% + 5.2%) / 3 = 4.5%

**Final Answer:** 4.5%

## Correct Answer

7.9%
