Let's assume these values are:\n    * FY2015 Operating Income: $X\n    * FY2016 Operating Income: $Y\n\n* **Calculate Year-over-Year Change:** Determine the change in operating income from FY2015 to FY2016:\n    * Change in Operating Income = $Y - $X\n\n* **Calculate Percentage Change:** Compute the percentage change in operating income:\n    * Percentage Change = [( $Y - $X ) / $X] * 100%\n\n* **Round to One Decimal Place:** Round the calculated percentage change to one decimal place.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Format the percentage change with one decimal place (e.g., 10.1%).\n*   If the percentage change is 0, state \"Nothing happened\".\n*   Present the final answer as a concise bullet point, including both the dollar change and the percentage change.  For example:\n    * Operating Income increased by $Z and 10.1% year-over-year.\n    * Or, if the change is zero: Nothing happened.\n\n\n```\n\n* FY2015 Operating Income: $903.095 millions\n* FY2016 Operating Income: $1493.602 millions\n* Change in Operating Income: $1493.602 millions - $903.095 millions = $590.507 millions\n* Percentage Change: ($590.507 millions / $903.095 millions) * 100% = 65.4%\n\n**Final Answer:** Operating income increased by $590.51 millions and 65.4% year-over-year.\n\n\n",
