Correct Document and Section: Analyze the balance sheet for Corning Incorporated for the fiscal year 2022.  Specifically, locate the values for \"Current Assets\" and \"Current Liabilities\".\n\n2. Detailed Analysis and Calculations:\n\n* **Step 1: Locate Current Assets and Current Liabilities:** Find the values for \"Total Current Assets\" and \"Total Current Liabilities\" from Corning's FY2022 balance sheet.  Let's assume (these values would be obtained from the actual financial statement):\n    * Total Current Assets = $X\n    * Total Current Liabilities = $Y\n\n* **Step 2: Calculate Working Capital:**  Working capital is calculated as:\n    * Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current Liabilities = $X - $Y = $Z\n\n* **Step 3: Assess Working Capital:** Determine if the calculated working capital ($Z) is positive. If $Z > 0, then Corning had a positive working capital. If $Z â‰¤ 0, then Corning did not have a positive working capital.\n\n3. Response Rules:\n\n*   The response should be a concise bullet point list.\n*   If the calculated working capital is positive, the response should confirm this and state the amount in the format specified in the Response Instructions.\n*   If the calculated working capital is not positive, the response should state that Corning did not have a positive working capital by FY 2022 close.\n*   No additional analysis or interpretation beyond confirming the positivity of working capital is needed.\n\n\n```\n\n* Located the 2022 and 2021 values for Total Current Assets and Total Current Liabilities on Corning Inc.'s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n* 2022:\n    * Total Current Assets: $7,453 million\n    * Total Current Liabilities: $6,622 million\n* 2021:\n    * Total Current Assets: $7,659 million\n    * Total Current Liabilities: $7,659 million\n* Calculated the working capital for 2022: $7,453 million - $6,622 million = $831 million\n\nFinal Answer: Yes. Corning had positive working capital of $831.00 million by FY 2022 close.\n\n\n",
  "answer": "Yes. Corning had a positive working capital amount of $831 million by FY 2022 close. This answer considers only operating current assets and current liabilities that were clearly shown in the balance sheet.",
