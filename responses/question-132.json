Analyze the \"PFIZER 2021 10K\" document, specifically focusing on the sections detailing the company's financial statements for 2019 and any accompanying notes or disclosures that discuss non-recurring or unusual items impacting net income.  Pay close attention to sections discussing one-time events, acquisitions, legal rulings, government regulatory actions, joint ventures, restructuring charges, asset impairments, or changes in accounting policy.\n\n\n2. **Detailed Analysis:**\n\n*   Carefully review the 2019 financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and notes) to identify any significant increases in net income compared to previous years.\n*   Identify any items explicitly labeled as non-recurring, unusual, or one-time events.  These are often disclosed separately in the notes to the financial statements.\n*   Analyze the descriptions of any acquisitions, legal settlements, or other significant transactions that occurred in 2019. Determine if these events had a material impact on net income. Quantify the impact of each event on net income if possible.\n*   Assess whether the identified events are outside of Pfizer's standard business operations.  Consider the nature of Pfizer's business and whether the events are typical occurrences within their industry.\n*   If any events are identified, describe them clearly and concisely.  Quantify their impact on net income in dollar terms and as a percentage change.\n\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Present the findings as a bulleted list.\n*   For each identified event:\n    *   Clearly describe the event.\n    *   State the increase in net income in dollars, formatted according to the provided guidelines.\n    *   State the percentage increase in net income, formatted according to the provided guidelines.\n*   If no such events are found, state \"No events outside of Pfizer's standard business operations substantially increased net income in 2019.\"\n*   All dollar values and percentages must be formatted according to the provided guidelines.\n\n\n```\n\n*   **Gain on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction:** Pfizer recognized a pre-tax gain of $3497 million on the completion of the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture transaction. This substantially increased net income.\n\n    *   Increase in Net Income: $3497.00 million\n    *   Percentage Increase: Not applicable, as calculating a percentage increase from a potentially negative baseline is not meaningful in this context.  The provided financial data does not allow for isolation of the impact of this gain on the overall net income percentage change.\n\n**Final Answer:** Pfizer's 2019 net income was substantially increased by a $3497.00 million pre-tax gain related to the Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture transaction.\n\n\n",
