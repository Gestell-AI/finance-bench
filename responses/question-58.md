1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the BLOCK 2020 10K document. Specifically, focus on the Statement of Income for fiscal years 2019 and 2020.

2. **Analysis and Calculations:**

* **Locate Total Revenue:** Find the "Total Revenue" figures for both FY2019 and FY2020 from the Statement of Income. Let's assume (these values would be obtained from the 10K):
    * FY2019 Total Revenue = $X
    * FY2020 Total Revenue = $Y

* **Calculate Revenue Growth:** Compute the revenue growth rate using the following formula:

    Revenue Growth Rate = [(FY2020 Total Revenue - FY2019 Total Revenue) / FY2019 Total Revenue] * 100

    Substitute the values of X and Y obtained from the 10K into the formula above.

* **Round to One Decimal Place:** Round the calculated revenue growth rate to one decimal place.

3. **Response Rules:**

*   Format the final answer as a percentage with one decimal place (e.g., 6.9%).
*   If the growth rate is 0, state "Nothing happened".
*   Present the final answer concisely as a bullet point.  For example:
    * FY2019-FY2020 Total Revenue Growth Rate: 6.9%

```

- Locate Total Revenue for FY2019: $4,713,500,000
- Locate Total Revenue for FY2020: $9,497,578,000
- Calculate the change in Total Revenue: $9,497,578,000 - $4,713,500,000 = $4,784,078,000
- Calculate the percentage change in Total Revenue: ($4,784,078,000 / $4,713,500,000) \* 100% = 101.5%

**Final Answer:** FY2019-FY2020 Total Revenue Growth Rate: 101.5%

## Correct Answer

101.5%
