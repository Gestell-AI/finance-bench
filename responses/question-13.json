Analyze Adobe's 2017 10K document, specifically the balance sheet and statement of cash flows for fiscal year 2017.\n\n2. **Detailed Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n   * **Step 1: Locate Cash from Operations:** Find the \"Cash flow from operating activities\" figure from the statement of cash flows for FY2017.  Let's assume this value is X.\n\n   * **Step 2: Locate Total Current Liabilities:** Find the \"Total current liabilities\" figure from the balance sheet for FY2017. Let's assume this value is Y.\n\n   * **Step 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:** Divide the cash from operations (X) by the total current liabilities (Y).\n\n     Operating Cash Flow Ratio = X / Y\n\n   * **Step 4: Round the Result:** Round the calculated ratio to two decimal places.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n   * The response should be a single number representing the operating cash flow ratio, rounded to two decimal places.\n   * The number should be presented without any additional text or explanation.\n   * If the calculation results in a zero, the response should be \"0.00\".\n\n\n```\n\n* **Cash from Operations:** $2.10 billions (Adobe 2017 10K, Cash Flow Statement)\n* **Total Current Liabilities:** $2.53 billions (Adobe 2017 10K, Balance Sheet)\n* **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:** $2.10 billions / $2.53 billions = 0.83\n\n**Final Answer:** 0.83\n\n\n",
