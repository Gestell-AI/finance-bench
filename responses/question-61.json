Specifically, focus on the revenue segments disclosed in the financial statements (likely the income statement or a related segment reporting section).\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n    * Locate the revenue breakdown by product or service category for the fiscal year 2022 (FY2022).  The 10-K should explicitly detail the revenue contribution of each segment.\n    * Identify the revenue for each product/service category.\n    * Calculate the percentage of total revenue for each category:  `(Revenue of Category / Total Revenue) * 100%`\n    * Identify any categories where the calculated percentage exceeds 20%.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n    * Present the findings as a concise, bulleted list.\n    * For each category exceeding 20% of revenue, state the category name and its percentage contribution to total revenue, formatted according to the specified guidelines (e.g., 21.5%).\n    * If no category exceeds 20%, state: \"No product or service category represents more than 20% of Boeing's revenue for FY2022.\"\n    * Use Markdown formatting as instructed.  Include dollar values and percentages as specified.\n    * The final answer should be a clear statement indicating whether any categories exceeded the 20% threshold and, if so, which ones.\n\n```\n\n*   **Total Revenue:** $66608.00 million\n*   Commercial Airplanes: $25867.00 million, 38.8%\n*   Defense, Space & Security: $23162.00 million, 34.8%\n*   Global Services: $17611.00 million, 26.4%\n\n**Final Answer:** Yes, three product/service categories represent more than 20% of Boeing's revenue for FY2022: Commercial Airplanes (38.8%), Defense, Space & Security (34.8%), and Global Services (26.4%).\n\n\n",
