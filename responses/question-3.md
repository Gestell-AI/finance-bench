1. Analyze document: 3M 2022 10K.  Specifically, extract data from the Balance Sheet and Income Statement for FY2022 to calculate the metrics required to assess capital intensity.

2. Detailed Analysis and Calculations:

* **Calculate Capital Expenditures (CapEx) to Revenue Ratio:**
    * Locate "Capital Expenditures" (CapEx) from the statement of cash flows for FY2022.
    * Locate "Total Revenue" from the income statement for FY2022.
    * Calculate the ratio: CapEx / Total Revenue.
    * Convert the ratio to a percentage by multiplying by 100. Round to 0 decimal places.

* **Calculate Fixed Assets to Total Assets Ratio:**
    * Locate "Property, Plant, and Equipment, net" (PP&E) from the balance sheet for FY2022.
    * Locate "Total Assets" from the balance sheet for FY2022.
    * Calculate the ratio: PP&E / Total Assets.
    * Convert the ratio to a percentage by multiplying by 100. Round to 0 decimal places.

* **Calculate Return on Assets (ROA):**
    * Locate "Net Income" from the income statement for FY2022.
    * Locate "Total Assets" from the balance sheet for FY2022 (average of beginning and ending balances if available, otherwise use the year-end balance).
    * Calculate ROA: (Net Income / Total Assets) * 100. Round to 0 decimal places.

3. Response Rules:

* Present the three calculated ratios (CapEx/Revenue, Fixed Assets/Total Assets, and ROA) as percentages rounded to 0 decimal places.
* Based on the calculated ratios, assess whether 3M is capital-intensive.  Consider industry benchmarks or comparisons to other companies if available within the 10K or other readily accessible information.  If no benchmarks are available, focus on the relative magnitudes of the calculated ratios.  A higher CapEx/Revenue ratio and a higher Fixed Assets/Total Assets ratio generally suggest a more capital-intensive business.  A lower ROA might also be indicative of capital intensity if it suggests that a large amount of assets are needed to generate a given level of profit.  Consider both sides of the argument (i.e., arguments for and against 3M being capital intensive based on the calculated ratios).
* Conclude with a statement summarizing whether 3M is considered capital-intensive based on the analysis and justification.  The conclusion should be clear and concise.


```

The user is asking whether 3M is a capital-intensive business based on its FY2022 financial data. To determine this, I need to calculate relevant financial ratios from the provided 10K document. The key ratios to consider are:

1. **Capital Expenditures (CapEx) to Revenue Ratio:** This indicates the proportion of revenue being reinvested in fixed assets. A higher ratio suggests capital intensity.
2. **Fixed Assets to Total Assets Ratio:** This shows the percentage of a company's assets tied up in fixed assets. A higher ratio suggests capital intensity.
3. **Return on Assets (ROA):** While not a direct measure of capital intensity, a lower ROA despite significant investment in assets could suggest capital intensity.

I will need to locate the following figures from the 3M 2022 10K:

- Capital Expenditures
- Total Revenue
- Property, Plant, and Equipment (Net)
- Total Assets
- Net Income \* Capital Expenditures (page 52): $1,750 millions

  - Total Revenue (page 78): $34,229 millions ($12,648 + $16,953 + $5,891 - $1,017 - $857 + $819 - $780)
  - Ratio: $1,750 / $34,229 = 0.0511
  - Percentage: 5%

- **Fixed Assets to Total Assets Ratio:**

  - Property, Plant, and Equipment, net (page 78): $16,953 millions
  - Total Assets (page 78): $47,950 millions
  - Ratio: $16,953 / $47,950 = 0.3536
  - Percentage: 35%

- **Return on Assets (ROA):**
  - Net Income (page 78): $5,777 millions
  - Total Assets (page 78): $47,950 millions
  - ROA: ($5,777 / $47,950) \* 100 = 12%

Based on these ratios:

- A CapEx to Revenue ratio of 5% suggests a moderate level of reinvestment in capital assets relative to revenue.
- A Fixed Assets to Total Assets ratio of 35% indicates a significant portion of 3M's assets are tied up in property, plant, and equipment, which is typical for a manufacturing company.
- An ROA of 12% indicates a reasonable return generated from the company's assets.

While 3M has a substantial investment in fixed assets, as shown by the Fixed Assets to Total Assets ratio, the CapEx to Revenue ratio is not exceptionally high, suggesting that while maintenance and strategic investments are ongoing, it's not in a phase of aggressive capital expansion relative to its revenue. The ROA suggests that the assets are being utilized effectively to generate profit.

**Final Answer:** Based on the FY2022 data, 3M exhibits characteristics of a moderately capital-intensive business due to its significant investment in fixed assets. However, its CapEx to Revenue ratio doesn't indicate extreme capital intensity.

## Correct Answer

No, the company is managing its CAPEX and Fixed Assets pretty efficiently, which is evident from below key metrics:
CAPEX/Revenue Ratio: 5.1%
Fixed assets/Total Assets: 20%
Return on Assets= 12.4%
