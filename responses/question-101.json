  "prompt": "In the document LOCKHEEDMARTIN 2020 10K, We need to calculate a reasonable approximation (or exact number if possible) of a financial metric. Basing your judgment by information plainly provided in the balance sheet and the P&L statement, what is Lockheed Martin's FY2020 asset turnover ratio? Asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2020 revenue / (average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places.",

Specifically, examine the balance sheet to find total assets for FY2019 and FY2020, and the income statement (P&L) to find FY2020 revenue.\n\n2. **Detailed Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n   * **Step 1: Find FY2020 Revenue:** Locate the total revenue figure for FY2020 from the income statement.  Let's assume this value is `X` (replace with the actual value from the 10K).\n\n   * **Step 2: Find FY2019 Total Assets:** Locate the total assets figure for FY2019 from the balance sheet. Let's assume this value is `A` (replace with the actual value from the 10K).\n\n   * **Step 3: Find FY2020 Total Assets:** Locate the total assets figure for FY2020 from the balance sheet. Let's assume this value is `B` (replace with the actual value from the 10K).\n\n   * **Step 4: Calculate Average Total Assets:** Calculate the average of total assets for FY2019 and FY2020 using the formula:  Average Total Assets = (A + B) / 2\n\n   * **Step 5: Calculate Asset Turnover Ratio:** Calculate the asset turnover ratio using the formula: Asset Turnover Ratio = FY2020 Revenue / Average Total Assets = X / [(A + B) / 2]\n\n   * **Step 6: Round the Result:** Round the calculated asset turnover ratio to two decimal places.\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n   * Follow the specified formatting rules for numbers (dollar values, percentages, ratios).\n   * Present the final answer as a single number rounded to two decimal places, representing the asset turnover ratio.  No additional commentary is needed beyond the numerical result.\n\n```\n\n* **FY2020 Revenue:** $65398.00 millions (from the 2020 10K Income Statement)\n* **FY2019 Total Assets:** $47528.00 millions (from the 2020 10K Balance Sheet)\n* **FY2020 Total Assets:** $50710.00 millions (from the 2020 10K Balance Sheet)\n* **Average Total Assets:** ($47528.00 millions + $50710.00 millions) / 2 = $49119.00 millions\n* **Asset Turnover Ratio:** $65398.00 millions / $49119.00 millions = 1.33\n\n**Final Answer:** 1.33\n\n\n",
