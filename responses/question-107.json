Correct document and section to analyze: MGMRESORTS 2022Q4 EARNINGS document; specifically, the section detailing the regional breakdown of EBITDAR contribution for the fiscal year 2022 (FY2022).  This will likely be in the earnings release or a supplemental financial statement.\n\n2. Detailed analysis and calculations:\n\n*   **Locate Regional EBITDAR Data:**  Find the table or section in the document that breaks down EBITDAR by region for FY2022.  The document should explicitly state the EBITDAR for each region (e.g., Las Vegas, Regional Operations, etc.).\n*   **Calculate Total EBITDAR:** Sum the EBITDAR figures for all regions to arrive at the company's total EBITDAR for FY2022.\n*   **Calculate Percentage Contribution:** For each region, divide the region's EBITDAR by the total EBITDAR and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n*   **Identify Highest Contributor:** Identify the region with the highest percentage contribution to the total EBITDAR.\n*   **Assess Other Regions:**  Briefly mention the contribution percentages of other regions to provide context.  This is important for a comprehensive answer.\n\n3. Response rules:\n\n*   The response should clearly state the region with the highest EBITDAR contribution.\n*   The response should include the percentage contribution of the highest contributing region, formatted to one decimal place (e.g., 90.0%).\n*   The response should briefly mention the contribution from other regions, providing a concise overview of the regional EBITDAR distribution.\n*   The response should follow the specified formatting rules for numbers and percentages as outlined in the `Response Instructions`.\n*   If no regional breakdown is provided, the response should clearly state that the information is unavailable.\n\n\n```\n\n* **Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR:** $3.1 billions\n* **Regional Operations Adjusted Property EBITDAR:** $1.3 billions\n* **MGM China Adjusted Property EBITDAR:** Loss of $203 millions (treated as negative value)\n* **Total Adjusted Property EBITDAR:** $3.1 billions + $1.3 billions - $203 millions = $4.2 billions\n\n* **Las Vegas Strip Resorts Contribution:** ($3.1 billions / $4.2 billions) * 100% = 73.8%\n* **Regional Operations Contribution:** ($1.3 billions / $4.2 billions) * 100% = 31.0%\n* **MGM China Contribution:** (-$203 millions / $4.2 billions) * 100% = -4.8%\n\n**Final Answer:** Las Vegas Strip Resorts had the highest Adjusted Property EBITDAR contribution at 73.8%, followed by Regional Operations at 31.0%, and MGM China with a negative contribution of -4.8%.\n\n\n",
