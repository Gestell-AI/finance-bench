1. Correct Document and Section: Analyze the balance sheet for Corning Incorporated for the fiscal year 2022.  Specifically, locate the values for "Current Assets" and "Current Liabilities".

2. Detailed Analysis and Calculations:

* **Step 1: Locate Current Assets and Current Liabilities:** Find the values for "Total Current Assets" and "Total Current Liabilities" from Corning's FY2022 balance sheet.  Let's assume (these values would be obtained from the actual financial statement):
    * Total Current Assets = $X
    * Total Current Liabilities = $Y

* **Step 2: Calculate Working Capital:**  Working capital is calculated as:
    * Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current Liabilities = $X - $Y = $Z

* **Step 3: Assess Working Capital:** Determine if the calculated working capital ($Z) is positive. If $Z > 0, then Corning had a positive working capital. If $Z â‰¤ 0, then Corning did not have a positive working capital.

3. Response Rules:

*   The response should be a concise bullet point list.
*   If the calculated working capital is positive, the response should confirm this and state the amount in the format specified in the Response Instructions.
*   If the calculated working capital is not positive, the response should state that Corning did not have a positive working capital by FY 2022 close.
*   No additional analysis or interpretation beyond confirming the positivity of working capital is needed.
