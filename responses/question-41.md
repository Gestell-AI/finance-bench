1. Analyze the AMERICANEXPRESS 2022 10K document, specifically focusing on the sections detailing operating margin or related financial metrics.  Look for information on operating income and revenue for both 2021 and 2022 to calculate the operating margin for each year.

2. **Analysis:**

*   The prompt asks whether American Express (AMEX) shows an *improving* operating margin profile in 2022.  This requires a comparison of the operating margin in 2022 to a prior period, likely 2021.  The provided instructions state that operating margin profile is not a useful metric for performance assessment. Therefore, the response should state this and explain why.

3. **Response Rules:**

*   Begin by stating that operating margin profile is not a useful metric for assessing AMEX's performance.
*   Explain why operating margin is not a suitable metric for a financial services company like AMEX.  This explanation should highlight the complexities of their business model (e.g., reliance on interest income, fees, and other revenue streams that are not directly captured by a simple operating margin calculation).  Mention that other metrics, such as return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), or net interest margin, might be more appropriate for evaluating AMEX's financial health.
*   Conclude by stating that no assessment of operating margin improvement can be made due to the unsuitability of the metric.  Do not attempt to calculate or interpret an operating margin.
*   Follow all formatting guidelines specified in the `Response Instructions`.

```

Operating margin profile is not a useful metric for assessing the performance of a financial services company like American Express. A traditional operating margin calculation doesn't adequately capture the complexities of AMEX's business model, which relies heavily on interest income, fees, and other revenue streams beyond standard operating revenues. Metrics like return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), and net interest margin are more appropriate for evaluating AMEX's financial health and profitability.

**Final Answer:** No assessment of operating margin improvement can be made due to the unsuitability of the metric.

## Correct Answer

Performance is not measured through operating margin
