1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the COCACOLA 2021 10K document, specifically the Income Statement section.

2. **Analysis and Calculations:**

* **Locate Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Find the value of "Cost of Goods Sold" from Coca-Cola's FY2021 income statement.  Let's assume this value is X.
* **Locate Net Revenue:** Find the value of "Net Revenue" or "Total Revenue" from Coca-Cola's FY2021 income statement. Let's assume this value is Y.
* **Calculate COGS Percentage Margin:** Use the formula: COGS Percentage Margin = (COGS / Net Revenue) * 100%.  Substitute the values of X and Y into this formula to calculate the percentage.  The result will be a percentage representing Coca-Cola's FY2021 COGS margin.

3. **Response Rules:**

*   Format the COGS Percentage Margin with 1 decimal place (e.g., 6.9%).
*   Present the final answer as a single bullet point stating the COGS percentage margin.  For example: * Coca-Cola's FY2021 COGS percentage margin was 6.9%*.
*   If the calculated margin is 0, respond with: *Nothing happened*.


```

- Coca-Cola's FY2021 COGS was $15357 million
- Coca-Cola's FY2021 Net Operating Revenue was $38655 million
- Coca-Cola's FY2021 COGS percentage margin is calculated as (COGS / Net Operating Revenue) _ 100 = ($15357 million / $38655 million) _ 100 = 39.7%

**Final Answer:** Coca-Cola's FY2021 COGS percentage margin was 39.7%

## Correct Answer

39.7%
