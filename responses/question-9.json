Analyze document `ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD 2019 10K`, specifically the Statement of Income and the Statement of Financial Position.\n\n2. **Detailed Analysis:**\n\n   * **Step 1: Identify Total Revenues for FY2019:** Locate the total revenue figure for the fiscal year 2019 from the Statement of Income.  Let's assume this value is `X`.\n\n   * **Step 2: Identify Net Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) for FY2018 and FY2019:** Find the Net PP&E values for both fiscal years 2018 and 2019 from the Statement of Financial Position. Let's assume the Net PP&E for FY2018 is `Y` and for FY2019 is `Z`.\n\n   * **Step 3: Calculate the Average Net PP&E:** Compute the average of Net PP&E for FY2018 and FY2019 using the formula:  Average Net PP&E = (`Y` + `Z`) / 2. Let's call this result `A`.\n\n   * **Step 4: Calculate the Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio:** Divide the total revenue for FY2019 (`X`) by the average Net PP&E (`A`): Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = `X` / `A`.\n\n   * **Step 5: Round the Result:** Round the calculated Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio to two decimal places as requested.\n\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n   * The response should be a concise markdown list outlining each step (1-5 above) with the corresponding values from the 10-K.\n   * The final answer should be presented as \"The FY2019 fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard is [calculated ratio].\"  The ratio should be formatted to two decimal places.\n   * No additional commentary or interpretation is needed beyond the calculation.\n\n\n```\n\nThe user wants to calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard in FY2019.\nThe formula for the fixed asset turnover ratio is: FY2019 Revenue / Average PP&E.\nAverage PP&E is calculated as (FY2018 PP&E + FY2019 PP&E) / 2.\n\nFrom the Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nFY2019 Total net revenues = 6489\n\nFrom the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nFY2018 Property and equipment, net = 282\nFY2019 Property and equipment, net = 253\n\nAverage PP&E = (282 + 253) / 2 = 535 / 2 = 267.5\n\nFixed Asset Turnover Ratio = 6489 / 267.5\n\nCalculate the final value and round to two decimal places.\n6489 / 267.5 = 24.2564486...\nRounded to two decimal places: 24.269 millions.\n*   Identified FY2018 property and equipment, net as $282 millions.\n*   Identified FY2019 property and equipment, net as $253 millions.\n*   Calculated average property and equipment as ($282 millions + $253 millions) / 2 = $267.5 millions.\n*   Calculated fixed asset turnover ratio as $6489 millions / $267.5 millions = 24.26.\n\n**Final Answer:** The FY2019 fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard is 24.26.\n\n\n",
