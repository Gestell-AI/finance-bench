1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the Nike 2023 10K document, specifically the Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal year 2023.

2. **Analysis:**

* Locate the Statement of Cash Flows within the 10K filing.
* Identify the three main sections: Operating Activities, Investing Activities, and Financing Activities.
* For each section, find the net cash flow (inflow or outflow).  This will be a single number representing the total cash generated or used in each activity.  Pay close attention to whether the number is positive (cash inflow) or negative (cash outflow).
* Compare the net cash flows from each section. The section with the highest positive number (or the lowest negative number) represents the activity that brought in the most cash or lost the least.

3. **Response Rules:**

* Present the findings as a concise bullet point list.
* Clearly state which activity (Operating, Investing, or Financing) resulted in the highest net cash inflow or lowest net cash outflow for FY2023.
* Quantify the net cash flow for each activity using the correct formatting (billions with one decimal place and a zero).
* Do not include any additional commentary or interpretation beyond identifying the activity with the most positive or least negative cash flow.  The prompt only asks for which activity had the most positive or least negative cash flow.

```

- **Operating Activities:** $5.8 billions
- **Investing Activities:** $0.6 billions
- **Financing Activities:** Decrease in $7.4 billions

**Final Answer:** Operating activities brought in the most cash flow with $5.8 billions.
