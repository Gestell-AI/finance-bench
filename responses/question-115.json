  "prompt": "In the document NIKE 2018 10K, We need to calculate a reasonable approximation (or exact number if possible) of a financial metric. Basing your judgment by information plainly provided in the statement of income, what is Nike's three year average of cost of goods sold as a % of revenue from FY2016 to FY2018? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place.",

Specifically, focus on the Statement of Income for fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018.\n\n2. **Detailed Analysis and Calculations:**\n\n* **Step 1: Locate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Revenue for each fiscal year (FY2016, FY2017, FY2018).**  Extract the values for COGS and Revenue from the Statement of Income for each of the three fiscal years.\n\n* **Step 2: Calculate the COGS as a percentage of revenue for each year.** For each year, divide the COGS by the Revenue and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\n    * **FY2016:** (COGS FY2016 / Revenue FY2016) * 100 = Percentage for FY2016\n    * **FY2017:** (COGS FY2017 / Revenue FY2017) * 100 = Percentage for FY2017\n    * **FY2018:** (COGS FY2018 / Revenue FY2018) * 100 = Percentage for FY2018\n\n* **Step 3: Calculate the three-year average.** Sum the percentages calculated in Step 2 for FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018, then divide by 3.\n\n    * Three-Year Average = (Percentage for FY2016 + Percentage for FY2017 + Percentage for FY2018) / 3\n\n* **Step 4: Round to one decimal place.** Round the final three-year average percentage to one decimal place.\n\n\n3. **Response Rules:**\n\n*   Present the final answer as a single bullet point.\n*   Format the percentage with one decimal place (e.g., 6.9%).\n*   The response should clearly state the three-year average COGS as a percentage of revenue.  No additional commentary is needed.\n\n```\n\n* FY2016: ($20441/$36397) * 100 = 56.2%\n* FY2017: ($19038/$34350) * 100 = 55.4%\n* FY2018: ($17405/$32376) * 100 = 53.8%\n* Three-year average: (56.2% + 55.4% + 53.8%) / 3 = 55.1%\n\n**Final Answer:** 55.1%\n\n\n",
