1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the BESTBUY 2024Q2 10Q document. Specifically, examine the balance sheets for Fiscal Year 2023 (FY2023) and the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 (Q2 FY2024).  Locate the line item "Cash and Cash Equivalents" on both balance sheets.

2. **Analysis and Calculation:**

* **Step 1:** Find the value of "Cash and Cash Equivalents" reported in the FY2023 balance sheet.  Let's call this value A.
* **Step 2:** Find the value of "Cash and Cash Equivalents" reported in the Q2 FY2024 balance sheet. Let's call this value B.
* **Step 3:** Calculate the difference: Difference = A - B.  If the difference is positive, it indicates a decrease. If it is negative, it indicates an increase. If it is zero, there was no change.
* **Step 4:** Calculate the percentage change: Percentage Change = ( (A - B) / A ) * 100%.  A positive percentage indicates a decrease, a negative percentage indicates an increase, and 0% indicates no change.

3. **Response Rules:**

*   Format the dollar amount difference according to the provided guidelines (millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero).  If the difference is a decrease, state it as "decrease in $X". If there is no change, state "nothing happened".
*   Format the percentage change according to the provided guidelines (1 decimal place). If there is no change, state "nothing happened".
*   Present the final answer as two bullet points: one for the dollar amount change and one for the percentage change.  Follow the specified formatting rules exactly.

- Cash and cash equivalents for FY2023 (January 28, 2023): $1874 millions
- Cash and cash equivalents for Q2 FY2024 (July 29, 2023): $1093 millions
- Difference: $1874 millions - $1093 millions = $781 millions
- Percent change: ($781 millions / $1874 millions) \* 100% = 41.7%

**Final Answer:**

- Decrease in $781.00 millions
- 41.7%
