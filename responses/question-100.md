1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the KRAFTHEINZ 2019 10K document. Specifically, focus on the balance sheet to find the inventory values for FY2018 and FY2019, and the income statement (P&L) to find the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2019.

2. **Detailed Analysis and Calculations:**

   * **Step 1: Locate COGS for FY2019:** Find the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) figure for the fiscal year 2019 from Kraft Heinz's income statement.  Let's assume this value is X.

   * **Step 2: Determine Beginning and Ending Inventory:**
      * **Beginning Inventory:** Locate the "Inventory" value at the end of FY2018 from the balance sheet. Let's assume this value is Y.
      * **Ending Inventory:** Locate the "Inventory" value at the end of FY2019 from the balance sheet. Let's assume this value is Z.

   * **Step 3: Calculate Average Inventory:**
      * Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (Y + Z) / 2

   * **Step 4: Compute the Inventory Turnover Ratio:**
      * Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory = X / ((Y + Z) / 2)

   * **Step 5: Round the Result:** Round the calculated Inventory Turnover Ratio to two decimal places.

3. **Response Rules:**

   * Present the final answer as a single number rounded to two decimal places.  For example: "6.78"
   * If the calculation results in a zero, respond with "Nothing happened".
   * Do not include any additional text or interpretation beyond the numerical result.

```

- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) FY2019:** $12279 millions (from the Income Statement)
- **Inventory FY2018:** $2721 millions
- **Inventory FY2019:** $2279 millions
- **Average Inventory:** ($2721 millions + $2279 millions) / 2 = $2500 millions
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** $12279 millions / $2500 millions = 4.91

**Final Answer:** 4.91

## Correct Answer
