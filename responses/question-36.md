1. **Document and Section:** Analyze the AMD 2022 10K document, specifically the Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal year 2022.

2. **Analysis:**

* Locate the Statement of Cash Flows within the 10-K report.
* Identify the three main sections: Operating Activities, Investing Activities, and Financing Activities.
* For each section, find the net cash flow (inflow or outflow).  This will be a single number representing the total cash flow from each activity for the fiscal year.  Pay close attention to whether the number is positive (cash inflow) or negative (cash outflow).
* Compare the net cash flows from the three sections. The section with the highest positive number (or the lowest negative number) represents the activity that brought in the most cash or lost the least.

3. **Response Rules:**

* Present the findings as a concise bullet point list.
* State the section (Operating, Investing, or Financing Activities) that had the highest net cash inflow or the lowest net cash outflow for FY22.
* If a section resulted in a net cash outflow, clearly indicate this with a negative sign.
* Format numbers according to the provided guidelines (millions with 2 decimal places, billions with 1 decimal place and a zero, percentages with 1 decimal place, ratios as specified).  Do not include commas in dollar values.
* The final answer should clearly state which activity generated the most positive cash flow or the least negative cash flow.  If all sections show negative cash flow, state which section had the least negative cash flow.  If the net cash flow is zero for all sections, state that nothing happened.
