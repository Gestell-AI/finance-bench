Analyze the \"NETFLIX 2015 10K\" document, specifically the Statement of Income and Statement of Cash Flows for Fiscal Year 2015.\n\n2. Detailed Analysis and Calculations:\n\n* **Locate Unadjusted Operating Income:** Find the \"Operating Income\" figure from the income statement for FY2015.  Let's assume this value is X.\n* **Locate Depreciation and Amortization (D&A):** Find the \"Depreciation and Amortization\" expense from the statement of cash flows for FY2015. Let's assume this value is Y.\n* **Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA:** Use the formula from the provided instructions:  `EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A`. Therefore, `EBITDA = X + Y`. Let's assume the calculated EBITDA is Z.\n* **Locate Revenue:** Find the \"Total Revenue\" figure from the income statement for FY2015. Let's assume this value is W.\n* **Calculate EBITDA Margin:** Use the formula: `EBITDA Margin = (EBITDA / Revenue) * 100`. Therefore, `EBITDA Margin = (Z / W) * 100`.  This will give you the EBITDA percentage margin for FY2015. Let's assume the calculated margin is P%.\n\n3. Response Rules:\n\n* Format the EBITDA value (Z) according to the specified rules for dollar amounts (millions or billions as appropriate).\n* Format the EBITDA margin (P%) according to the specified rules for percentages (one decimal place).\n* Present the final answer as a concise bullet point summary including both the dollar value of EBITDA and the percentage margin.  If the calculated values are zero, state \"nothing happened\".  The response should end with \"**Final Answer:**\"\n\n```\n\n* **Locate Unadjusted Operating Income:** The 2015 10K filing shows an operating income of $305.83 millions.\n* **Locate Depreciation and Amortization (D&A):** The 2015 10K filing shows D&A of $566.88 millions.\n* **Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA:** $305.83 millions (Operating Income) + $566.88 millions (D&A) = $872.71 millions.\n* **Locate Revenue:** The 2015 10K filing shows revenue of $6779.51 millions.\n* **Calculate EBITDA Margin:** ($872.71 millions / $6779.51 millions) * 100 = 12.9%\n\n**Final Answer:** $872.71 millions, 12.9%\n\n\n",
