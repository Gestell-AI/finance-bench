1. Analyze Adobe's 2017 10K document, specifically the balance sheet and statement of cash flows for fiscal year 2017.

2. **Detailed Analysis and Calculations:**

   * **Step 1: Locate Cash from Operations:** Find the "Cash flow from operating activities" figure from the statement of cash flows for FY2017.  Let's assume this value is X.

   * **Step 2: Locate Total Current Liabilities:** Find the "Total current liabilities" figure from the balance sheet for FY2017. Let's assume this value is Y.

   * **Step 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:** Divide the cash from operations (X) by the total current liabilities (Y).

     Operating Cash Flow Ratio = X / Y

   * **Step 4: Round the Result:** Round the calculated ratio to two decimal places.

3. **Response Rules:**

   * The response should be a single number representing the operating cash flow ratio, rounded to two decimal places.
   * The number should be presented without any additional text or explanation.
   * If the calculation results in a zero, the response should be "0.00".


```

- **Cash from Operations:** $2.10 billions (Adobe 2017 10K, Cash Flow Statement)
- **Total Current Liabilities:** $2.53 billions (Adobe 2017 10K, Balance Sheet)
- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:** $2.10 billions / $2.53 billions = 0.83

**Final Answer:** 0.83

## Correct Answer

0.83
