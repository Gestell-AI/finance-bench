## Calculating Quick Ratio

**Quick Ratio** = (**Total Current Assets** - **Inventories**) / **Current Liabilities**

### Calculation Steps

1. **Determine Total Current Assets**:

    * Obtain the total current assets from the company's balance sheet.

2. **Subtract Inventories**:

    * Deduct the value of inventories from the total current assets to calculate **Quick Assets**.
    * **Quick Assets** = **Total Current Assets** - **Inventories**

3. **Identify Current Liabilities**:

    * Obtain the total current liabilities from the company's balance sheet.

4. **Calculate the Quick Ratio**:

    * Divide the **Quick Assets** by the **Current Liabilities**.
    * **Quick Ratio** = **Quick Assets** / **Current Liabilities**

**Interpretation**: Any quick ratio below 1.0 is unhealthy and should be stated as such

## EBITDA

1. **Using Net Income:**

    * **EBITDA** = **Net Income** + **Taxes** + **Interest Expense** + **D&A**

2. **Using Operating Income:**

    * **EBITDA** = **Operating Income** + **D&A**
    * **D&A** = **Depreciation and Amortization**

* **Net Income:** The total profit of a company after all expenses and taxes have been deducted from revenue.
* **Taxes:** Government levies on a company's earnings.
* **Interest Expense:** The cost incurred by an entity for borrowed funds.
* **Operating Income:** Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), representing the profit from operations.
* **Depreciation and Amortization (D&A):** Non-cash expenses that reduce the value of assets over time.

**Note:** EBITDAR is different to EBIT and EBITDA and should be treated as a completely separate entity

## Formula and Calculation of CapEx

Capital expenditures (**CapEx**) are essential for understanding a company's investment in its operations. Below are the formulas and calculations for **CapEx** and **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)**.

### CapEx Formula

**CapEx** = **Δ PP&E** + **Current Depreciation**

* **CapEx** = Capital Expenditures
* **Δ PP&E** = Change in Property, Plant, and Equipment

## Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) Formula

**FCFE** = **EP** − (**CE** − **D**) × (1 − **DR**) − **ΔC** × (1 − **DR**)

* **FCFE** = Free Cash Flow to Equity
* **EP** = Earnings per Share
* **CE** = CapEx
* **D** = Depreciation
* **DR** = Debt Ratio
* **ΔC** = Δ Net Capital, Change in Net Working Capital

## Instructions to Calculate Inventory Turnover Ratio

1. **Locate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**

    * Access the company's income statement.
    * Find the total cost of goods sold for the accounting period.

2. **Determine the Beginning and Ending Inventory Levels:**

    * Access the company's balance sheets for the current and previous periods.

    * **Beginning Inventory**:

        * Use the ending inventory from the previous accounting period.

    * **Ending Inventory**:

        * Use the ending inventory from the current accounting period.

3. **Calculate the Average Inventory:**

    * Use the formula:

        * **Average Inventory** = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) ÷ 2

4. **Compute the Inventory Turnover Ratio:**

    * Use the formula:

        * **Inventory Turnover Ratio** = COGS ÷ Average Inventory

5. **Interpret the Inventory Turnover Ratio:**

    * A higher ratio indicates efficient management of inventory and strong sales.
    * A lower ratio may suggest overstocking, obsolescence, or weak sales.

**Note:** Ensure all figures used are for the same accounting period for accuracy.

## Calculating the Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio

Calculations:

1. **Identify Total Revenues**:

    * Total revenues: [Total Revenues]

2. **Identify Net Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) for two periods**:

    * Net PP&E at the end of Period 1: [Net PP&E Period 1]
    * Net PP&E at the end of Period 2: [Net PP&E Period 2]

3. **Calculate the Average Net PP&E**:

    * Average Net PP&E = (Net PP&E Period 1 + Net PP&E Period 2) divided by 2

4. **Calculate the Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio**:

    * Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = Total Revenues divided by Average Net PP&E

## Calculating Retention Ratio

**Formulas:**

1. **Using Retained Earnings:Retention Ratio** = **Retained Earnings** / **Net Income**

    * **Retained Earnings:** Located in the shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet, it represents the cumulative amount of earnings retained in the company.
    * **Net Income:** Found at the bottom line of the income statement, it is the total profit of the company after all expenses and taxes have been deducted.

2. **Using Dividends Distributed:Retention Ratio** = (**Net Income** − **Dividends Distributed**) / **Net Income**

    * **Net Income:** The total profit of the company after all expenses and taxes have been deducted, found on the income statement.
    * **Dividends Distributed:** Located in the financing section of the statement of cash flows, it represents the total dividends paid out to shareholders.

**Components:**

* **Retained Earnings Method:**

  * **Retained Earnings:** Cumulative earnings retained in the business.
  * **Net Income:** Profit after expenses and taxes.

* **Dividends Method:**

  * **Net Income:** Profit after expenses and taxes.
  * **Dividends Distributed:** Total dividends paid to shareholders.

## Calculate Capital Intensity

* Capital Intensity is much different to the Capital Intensity Ratio. Understand the user when asking between Capital Intensity versus Capital Intensity Ratio.

* Capital Intensity is calculated by doing the following: *

    1. State the Capex/Revenue Ratio as a rounded %, 0 decimals

  * 1. State the Fixed Assets/Total Assets as a rounded %, 0 decimals
  * 1. State the ROA a rounded %, 0 decimals

## Calculate Capital Intensity Ratio

Capital Intensity Ratio = Total Assets / Total Revenue

1. **Gather Required Financial Data**

* **Total Assets**: Obtain the total assets from the company's balance sheet.
* **Total Revenue**: Obtain the total revenue from the company's income statement (also known as operating revenues or net sales).

1. **Perform the Calculation**

* Divide the total assets by the total revenue: Capital Intensity Ratio = Total Assets ÷ Total Revenue

43 **Interpret the Result**

* A **higher ratio** indicates the company requires more assets to generate each dollar of revenue, which may suggest lower operational efficiency.
* A **lower ratio** implies higher efficiency, as less capital is needed to generate revenue.

## Calculating DPO (or Days Payable Outstanding)

**Step 1: Identify Accounts Payable for the two most recent fiscal years**

* Accounts Payable for the prior year
* Accounts Payable for the current year

**Step 2: Calculate Average Accounts Payable** Average Accounts Payable = (Accounts Payable for the prior year + Accounts Payable for the current year) / 2

**Step 3: Identify Inventory for the two most recent fiscal years**

* Inventory for the prior year
* Inventory for the current year

**Step 4: Calculate Change in Inventory** Change in Inventory = Inventory for the current year - Inventory for the prior year

**Step 5: Obtain Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for the current fiscal year**

* COGS for the current year

**Step 6: Calculate the Denominator** Total Cost = COGS for the current year + Change in Inventory

**Step 7: Calculate Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)** DPO = (365 × Average Accounts Payable) / Total Cost

## Remember The Following

* **PPNE**: also known as PP&E is a term used to describe Property, Plant and Equipment.
* **Acquisitions**: Clearly describe all acquisitions and their value if applicable in bullet points.
* **Quarters and Fiscal Years**: Check the quarter of the company, if it is Q4, assume that it is the end of the fiscal year and the reporting period will have both reporting for the quarter and the full fiscal year. Pay attention to if the question is asking for information related to the quarter or the full fiscal year. Check the fiscal year period of the company, some companies have fiscal year ends different than the calendar year ending in December. Do not assume that the fiscal year corresponds to a December year end without checking first.
* **One-time events**: Oftentimes companies will have one-time events that may drive substantial changes in financial metrics like net income. These events include acquisitions, legal rulings, government regulatory actions, joint ventures, restructuring charges, asset impairments, or changes in accounting policy. Clearly outline each event in bullet points.
* **Spin Offs**: Spin Offs are also known as **separations** track all changes in regards to these. Spinning off a subsidiary will result in investors receiving shares in the new created entity, along with maintaining their position in the current parent company. This may be done for tax or strategic reasons and companies will report their spinoffs differently, pay attention to the treatment or mention of spin offs in financial statements
* **Organic Sales vs Net Sales**: Ensure that you categorize organic sales and net sales individually as separate indices
* **EBITDA vs. EBITDAR** Note the difference between EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax and depreciation) and EBITDAR (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and Rent). Note that EBITDAR will be relevant for businesses where rent is a high cost such as airlines, retail or hospitality, for example, but not most other businesses.
* **Interest Coverage Ratio** When calculating interest coverage ratio, check the formula and the figures you are using. Note that EBIT is equivalent to Operating Income so if it is asking you to use EBIT, and you can’t find it cited, you likely will be able to find Operating Income
* **Working Capital** Working Capital is equal to Current Assets - Current Liabilities, this will be found in the Balance Sheet. The Change in Working Capital can be indicative of the health of the business and be a key consideration in how a business can continue its operations.
* **Operating Margin Profile**: You cannot assess performance using this metric
* **Gross Margin**, You cannot assess performance using this metric
